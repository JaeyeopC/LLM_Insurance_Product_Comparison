Menschenrechte  1.   2. MENSCHENRECHTESeit dem Jahr 2023 verpflichtet das deutscheLieferkettensorgfaltspflichtengesetz (LkSG) auch Versicherungen, in ihrenLieferketten menschenrechtliche und umweltbezogene Sorgfaltspflichten inangemessener Weise zu beachten. Ziel ist es, menschenrechtlichen undumweltbezogenen Risiken vorzubeugen bzw. sie zu minimieren und die Verletzungmenschenrechtsbezogener oder umweltbezogener Pflichten zu beenden. Das LkSGverpflichtet Unternehmen zudem zur Abgabe einer Grundsatzerklärung.  Die Generali in Deutschland hat zum 1. Januar 2023 die Umsetzung für dieGenerali Deutschland AG und zum 1. Januar 2024 für Generali DeutschlandServices GmbH entsprechend den gesetzlichen Vorgaben vorgenommen. Über diegesetzliche Verpflichtung hinaus wurden grundsätzlich alle deutschenTochtergesellschaften im Rahmen der LkSGUmsetzung einbezogen. Generali in Deutschland umfasst in der Regel GeneraliGesellschaften, die in Deutschland ihren Hauptsitz haben. Dazu gehören z.B. auch die Marken Cosmos Direkt oder Dialog mit ihren jeweiligen Versicherungsunternehmen und die Generali Deutschland Services GmbH.

ACHTUNG DER MENSCHENRECHTEDie Generali in Deutschland (im Folgenden: Generali) ist sich ihrerunternehmerischen Verantwortung zur Achtung der Menschen und Umweltrechtebewusst. Wir verpflichten uns, menschenrechtliche und umweltbezogeneSorgfaltspflichten in unseren Lieferketten in angemessener Weise zuberücksichtigen und Betroffenen von entsprechenden Verstößen Zugang zu Abhilfezu ermöglichen. Dabei richten wir unser unternehmerisches Handeln aninternational anerkannten Leitprinzipien für Wirtschaft und Menschenrechte derVereinten Nationen aus und setzen somit die Anforderungen des NationalenAktionsplans für Wirtschaft und Menschenrechte und des deutschenLieferkettensorgfaltspflichtengesetzes um.Unser Verständnis und unsere menschenrechtlichen Standards beruhen auffolgenden international anerkannten Grundsätzen:   Die Internationale Menschenrechtscharta, d.h. die Allgemeine Erklärung der Menschenrechte der Vereinten Nationen sowie der Zivilpakt und der Sozialpakt, in denen bürgerliche, politische und soziale Rechte definiert sind, die allen Menschen um ihrer Würde willen zustehen.   Die Kernarbeitsnormen der Internationalen Arbeitsorganisation (ILO) mit ihren fünf Grundprinzipien zu Vereinigungsfreiheit und Recht auf Kollektivverhandlungen, der Beseitigung von Zwangsarbeit, der Abschaffung von Kinderarbeit sowie dem Verbot der Diskriminierung in Beschäftigung und Beruf sowie Arbeitsschutz und Arbeitssicherheit.Darüber hinaus unterstützen wir die in der Initiative UN Global Compactfestgelegten Prinzipien zu Menschen und Arbeitsrechten; in Bezug aufspezifische internationale Standards im Versicherungssektor hat dieinternationale Generali Group die Prinzipien für verantwortungsvollesInvestieren (PRI) und die Prinzipien für nachhaltige Versicherungen (PSI)unterzeichnet. Beide Initiativen wurden von den Vereinten Nationen ins Lebengerufen und unterstützt.2\\\\. UNSER VORGEHENDas Bekenntnis zu den genannten Abkommen und Grundsätzen sowie internenDokumente der internationalen Generali Group tragen dazu bei, die Achtung derMenschen und Umweltrechte angemessen in unseren Lieferketten zugewährleisten. Gleichzeitig stellen sie unsere umwelt undmenschenrechtsbezogenen Erwartungen an uns, unsere Mitarbeiterinnen undMitarbeiter und unsere Lieferanten und Vertragspartner im Sinne des LkSG (imFolgenden: „Lieferanten/Vertragspartner“) dar. Die Verpflichtung zurangemessenen Berücksichtigung entsprechender Rechte ergibt sich insbesondereauch aus den nachfolgend aufgelisteten internen Dokumenten:   Code of Conduct (Verhaltenskodex)   Integration of Sustainability into Investments and Active Ownership Guideline   Responsible Underwriting Group Guideline   Ethical Code for Suppliers (EthikKodex für Lieferanten der Generali Gruppe)   Sustainability Group Guideline (KonzernNachhaltigkeitsrichtlinie)   Deutsche Nachhaltigkeitsrichtlinie   Generali Group´s Charter of Sustainability Commitments (Nachhaltigkeitscharta der internationalen Generali Group)   Europäischen SozialchartaDie internationale Generali Group hat in ihrer „Human Rights Strategy“detailliert ihre Haltung zu Menschenrechten dargelegt.Unter Nachhaltigkeitsstrategie und Nachhaltigkeit & Verantwortung finden Sieumfangreiche Informationen über Ambitionen, Haltung und Maßnahmen der Generaliin Deutschland.3\\\\. UNSERE MITARBEITERINNEN UND MITARBEITERWir bieten ein Arbeitsumfeld, das frei von jeglicher Form von Diskriminierung,Belästigung, Einschüchterung oder Mobbing ist, und wir fördern Vielfalt undInklusion, weil wir glauben, dass die Zusammenarbeit zwischen Menschen mitunterschiedlichen Fähigkeiten, Perspektiven, Hintergründen und Kulturen einSchlüsselelement für die Geschäftstätigkeit ist.Wir erkennen auch das Recht unserer Mitarbeiterinnen und Mitarbeiter aufVereinigungsfreiheit und Kollektivverhandlungen an und dulden keine Form vonillegaler Arbeit oder Ausbeutung, Zwangs und Kinderarbeit.Die Grundrechte der Arbeitnehmer werden auch in der Europäischen Sozialcharta,die in Zusammenarbeit mit dem Europäischen Betriebsrat des Konzernsausgearbeitet wurde, im Verhaltenskodex und in der Nachhaltigkeitscharta derinternationalen Generali Group bekräftigt.4\\\\. UNSERE LIEFERANTEN/VERTRAGSPARTNERUm ein verantwortungsbewusstes Handeln entlang unserer Lieferkette unterangemessener Einhaltung der Grundsätze der Menschen und Umweltrechte zugewährleisten, verlangt die Generali von ihren Vertragspartnern (Lieferanten,Dienstleister und Kooperationspartner), dass sie auf allen Ebenen ihrerLieferkette die in den Konzernleitlinien festgelegten Grundsätze respektieren,wie zum Beispiel den Ethikkodex für Lieferanten der internationalen GeneraliGroup und den Code of Conduct sowie die wichtigsten nationalen undinternationalen Standards, beispielsweise die Grundkonvention derInternationalen Arbeitsorganisation (ILO) und die Allgemeine Erklärung derMenschenrechte der Vereinten Nationen.Wir gestalten die Beziehungen zu unseren Vertragspartnernverantwortungsbewusst – wir lehnen moderne Sklaverei und Menschenhandel in allihren Formen ab und tolerieren sie nicht in unserer Lieferkette. Die Generaligewährleistet ein effektives und effizientes Beschaffungsmanagement, indem dieBeschaffung von Dienstleistungen und Gütern klar im Rahmen einerEinkaufsrichtlinie strukturiert wird. Demnach sind alle Beschaffungsvorgängebis auf definierte Ausnahmen, über den international sowie nationalaufgestellten Einkauf abzubilden. Durch die Integration externerKooperationspartner wird im Unternehmensbereich Schaden der Generali eineffektives und effizientes sowie kundenorientiertes Schadenmanagementsichergestellt. Der Anbindungsprozess von externen Kooperationspartnern unddie diesbezüglichen Verantwortlichkeiten sind in einer entsprechendenLeitlinie geregelt. Kooperationspartner im Kontext des Schadenmanagements derGenerali sind Lieferanten/Vertragspartner im Sinne des LkSG und fallen indessen Anwendungsbereich. Die zur Wahrung von Menschenrechten und Minimierungvon Umweltrisiken notwendigen Sorgfaltsprozesse im Kontext vonBeschaffungsvorgängen und Kooperationspartnern des UnternehmensbereichsSchaden werden kontinuierlich weiterentwickelt und an veränderte Bedingungenangepasst.  I. Ver\\xadfah\\xadren zur Wah\\xadrung der Pflich\\xadten1\\\\. ANGEMESSENES UND WIRKSAMES RISIKOMANAGEMENTDie Generali hat ein etabliertes GovernanceSystem (Geschäftsorganisation) zumManagement aller relevanten Risiken (unter anderem Umwelt undMenschenrechtsrisiken) eingerichtet, welches eine solide und umsichtigeLeitung jedes Konzernunternehmens gewährleistet. Kernbestandteile derGeschäftsorganisation sind das Risikomanagementsystem (RMS), das interneKontrollsystem (IKS) sowie die vier unabhängigen Kontrollfunktionen –RisikomanagementFunktion (RMF), ComplianceFunktion (CF), Funktion derInternen Revision (IRF) und Versicherungsmathematische Funktion (VMF). Das RMSist so gestaltet, dass die Identifikation, Bewertung, Überwachung, Minderungund Berichterstattung der eingegangenen und potenziellen Risiken sowie derenAggregation unter Berücksichtigung der Abhängigkeiten jederzeit möglich sind.Das IKS ist der zweite Kernbestandteil des GovernanceSystems und umfasstAspekte, wie zum Beispiel Internes Kontrollumfeld, Interne Kontrollmaßnahmen,Kontrollbewusstsein sowie Überwachung und Berichterstattung. Das IKS folgt derSystematik der „Three Lines of Defense”. Hier bilden die klassischenManagementkontrollen (einschließlich derer durch denMenschenrechtsbeauftragten – siehe Kapitel II, §2) die ersteVerteidigungslinie; die RMF, die CF und die VMF befinden sich auf der zweitenEbene, und die unabhängige Überwachung durch die Konzernrevision stellt diedritte Verteidigungslinie dar.2\\\\. PRIORISIERUNG VON MENSCHENRECHTS UND UMWELTRISIKENWir bekennen uns zur Achtung aller international anerkannten Menschenrechtesowie internationalen Umweltkonventionen und legen den Fokus unserermenschenrechtlichen und umweltbezogenen Sorgfaltsprozesse gemäß § 2 Absatz 2und 3 Lieferkettensorgfaltspflichtengesetz auf folgende Menschenrechts undumweltbezogene Themen.Menschenrechtsrisiken:   Verstoß gegen das Verbot von Kinderarbeit   Verstoß gegen das Verbot von Zwangsarbeit und aller Formen der Sklaverei   Missachtung von Arbeitsschutz und arbeitsbedingten Gesundheitsgefahren   Missachtung der Koalitionsfreiheit, Vereinigungsfreiheit und Recht auf Kollektivverhandlungen   Verstoß gegen das Verbot der Ungleichbehandlung in Beschäftigung   Verstoß gegen das Verbot des Vorenthaltens eines angemessenen Lohns   Zerstörung der natürlichen Lebensgrundlage durch Umweltverunreinigungen   Widerrechtliche Verletzung von Landrechten   Verstoß gegen das Verbot der Beauftragung oder Nutzung privater/öffentlicher Sicherheitskräfte, die aufgrund mangelnder Unterweisung oder Kontrolle zu Beeinträchtigungen führen können   Verstoß gegen das Verbot eines Tuns oder pflichtwidrigen Unterlassens, das unmittelbar geeignet ist, in besonders schwerwiegender Weise eine geschützte Rechtsposition (das heißt weitere Menschenrechte) zu beeinträchtigen und dessen Rechtswidrigkeit bei verständiger Würdigung aller in Betracht kommenden Umstände offensichtlich istUmweltbezogene Risiken:   Verstoß gegen ein aus dem MinamataÜbereinkommen resultierendes Verbot (das MinamataÜbereinkommen ist ein völkerrechtlicher Vertrag aus dem Jahr 2013, mit dem die Emissionen und Freisetzungen des Schwermetalls Quecksilber eingedämmt werden sollen)   Verstoß gegen das Verbot der Produktion und/oder Verwendung von Stoffen im Anwendungsbereich der StockholmKonvention (POP) sowie nicht umweltgerechter Umgang mit POPhaltigen Abfällen   Verstoß gegen das Verbot der Ein und Ausfuhr gefährlicher Abfälle im Sinne des Basler ÜbereinkommensDie bisher durchgeführten Risikobewertungen im eigenen Geschäftsbereich undbei Lieferanten ergaben kein konkretes hohes Risiko, das einer Priorisierungund anschließenden Abhilfemaßnahmen erforderlich machen würde (siehe Abschnitt5).Im Übrigen wurde im eigenen Geschäftsbereich ein potenziell relevantes Risikohinsichtlich „Ungleichbehandlung im Beschäftigungsbereich“ festgestellt. Eswerden derzeit Maßnahmen zur Bewältigung und Minimierung dieses Risikosergriffen.Darüber hinaus wurden die Risiken analysiert, die von den Ländern und Branchenausgehen, in denen die Lieferanten des Unternehmens tätig sind. Infolgedessenfielen bestimmte Lieferanten in die Kategorie „mittleres Risiko“ und für siewerden vorbeugende Maßnahmen ergriffen.3\\\\. RISIKOMINIMIERUNG DURCH PRÄVENTIONSMASSNAHMEN IM EIGENEN GESCHÄFTSBEREICHWir überprüfen mindestens einmal jährlich sowie anlassbezogen, wiewirkungsvoll unsere bereits in der Präambel und nachfolgend beschriebenenMaßnahmen sind, um nachteilige menschenrechtliche Auswirkungen zu verhüten undabzumildern. Zudem prüfen wir, ob unsere Vorgaben eingehalten werden.Innerhalb unseres Unternehmens schulen wir gezielt die Mitarbeiterinnen undMitarbeiter, die regelmäßig mit Lieferanten/Vertragspartnern im Kontakt sind.Information und Sensibilisierung aller relevanten Mitarbeiterinnen undMitarbeiter sind erfolgt. Wir prüfen die Effektivität von Maßnahmen, indem wirdie Ergebnisse unserer kontinuierlichen Analyse menschenrechtlicher undumweltbezogener Risiken und Auswirkungen beobachten, analysieren,gegebenenfalls Präventionsmaßnahmen zu ergreifen (zum Beispiel Audits) undMissstände beheben. Um für unsere Geschäftspartner und für die Öffentlichkeitinsgesamt größtmögliche Transparenz hinsichtlich unserer eigenen Maßnahmen zuRisikominimierung zu bieten, haben wir ausführliche Antworten auf eineRisikoanalyse der spezialisierten Agentur Integrity Next hinterlegt. DieAntworten sind im OnlineUnternehmensprofil verfügbar und werden regelmäßigergänzt bzw. aktualisiert.Im eigenen Geschäftsbereich wurde im Jahr 2023 ein potenziell relevantesRisiko identifiziert. Das Risiko besteht in der möglichen Verletzung derGleichbehandlung und Chancengleichheit der Mitarbeiter des Unternehmens. DasUnternehmen beschloss, diesem potenziellen Risiko durch verschiedenevorbeugende Maßnahmen zu begegnen, darunter:   Eine geschlechtsunabhängige, faire und leistungsorientierte Bezahlung. Die Branchentarifverträge für die private Versicherungswirtschaft, die auch bei der Generali in Deutschland Anwendung finden, sind die Grundlage für eine geschlechtsunabhängige Vergütung im Tarifbereich   Seit 2019 wird mindestens einmal jährlich eine Gender/ Equal Pay Gap Analyse durchgeführt, um geschlechterspezifische Gehaltsunterschiede zu ermitteln, mit dem Ziel, etwaige historisch bedingte Gehaltsdifferenzen auf gleicher fachlicher Ebene zu schließen   Im Hinblick auf Gender Diversity ist die kontinuierliche Steigerung des Anteils der weiblichen Führungskräfte auf allen hierarchischen Ebenen ein zentrales Ziel   Women Mentoring Programme   AwarenessVeranstaltungen4\\\\. PRÄVENTIONSMASSNAHMEN GEGENÜBER UNMITTELBAREN LIEFERANTEN/VERTRAGSPARTNERIm Vorfeld einer neuen Vertragsbeziehung werden potenzielle Vertragspartner imRahmen eines geordneten Auswahlprozesses, welcher in der Einkaufsrichtliniestrukturiert, dokumentiert ist, ganzheitlich betrachtet und hinsichtlich derErfüllung fachlicher und technischer Anforderungen, der Wirtschaftlichkeitsowie der Nachhaltigkeit bewertet. Bei der Auswahl der Vertragspartner sindESGKriterien (ESG bedeutet Environmental, Social, Governance) hinterlegt, diesukzessive weiter ausgebaut und systematisiert werden.Zusätzlich zu den Regeln, die im Abschnitt \"Präambel  UnsereLieferanten/Vertragspartner\" aufgeführt sind, verlangt Generali von ihrenLieferanten/Vertragspartnern, dass sie sicherstellen:   Die Einhaltung der im Lieferkettensorgfaltspflichtengesetz formulierten menschenrechts und umweltbezogenen Anforderungen, auch durch Mitarbeiterinnen und Mitarbeiter und Zulieferer des unmittelbaren Lieferanten/Vertragspartners   Die Durchführung von Schulungen und Weiterbildungen zur Einhaltung der Anforderungen   Die Einräumung von Prüfungsrechten an die Generali, welche diese bei Kenntnis eines Risikos oder potenziellen Risikos ausüben darfAusnahmen sind möglich und werden auf der Grundlage der Ergebnisse derRisikobewertung nach den Vorgaben des LkSG gewährt.5\\\\. JÄHRLICHE ÜBERPRÜFUNG DER RISIKOLAGEWir erachten es als Bestandteil unserer Sorgfaltspflicht, potenziell undtatsächlich nachteilige menschenrechtliche und umweltbezogene Risiken undAuswirkungen unseres unternehmerischen Handelns auf Menschen und Umwelt zukennen. Daher ermitteln und bewerten wir mithilfe einer jährlichenRisikobewertung (bzw. anlassbezogen) die relevanten Menschenrechts undUmweltthemen unserer relevanten Geschäftstätigkeit sowie unserer direkten undindirekten Geschäftsbeziehungen. In diesem Prozess berücksichtigen wir auchmenschenrechtliche und umweltbezogene Informationen/ Hinweise von Dritten undgemeldete Vorfälle. Dazu beziehen wir in und externes menschenrechtliches undumweltbezogenes Expertenwissen, Geschäftspartner sowie ausgewählte Stakeholderein.Die Ergebnisse der Analyse menschenrechtlicher und umweltbezogener Risiken undAuswirkungen fließen in unsere unternehmerischen Entscheidungsprozesse inBezug auf die Lieferantenauswahl, das Geschäftspartnermanagement sowie dieProduktverantwortung und entwicklung ein. Die Risikoanalyse bildet dabei dieGrundlage für die Identifikation angemessener Maßnahmen. Darüber hinaus nutzenwir die Ergebnisse als Grundlage zur Erstellung und, wo nötig, Anpassunginterner Vorschriften, Prozesse und Schulungen, um den sich veränderndenAnforderungen an unsere Sorgfaltsprozesse Rechnung zu tragen.Im Jahr 2023 wurden für die Generali und ihre Dienstleister keinediesbezüglichen hohen Risiken oder Verstöße identifiziert, die entsprechenderAbhilfemaßnahmen erforderten.Die Generali ist in der Finanzdienstleistungsbranche tätig. Schon nach der Artder Dienstleistung ist das Risiko eines Verstoßes gegen menschen oderumweltrechtliche Sorgfaltspflichten daher als sehr gering einzustufen. Auchdas Länderrisiko ist als sehr gering einzustufen. Die Generali ist imWesentlichen in der Bundesrepublik Deutschland tätig. Auch ihre unmittelbarenLieferanten/Vertragspartner erbringen ihre Dienstleistung überwiegend in derBundesrepublik Deutschland, zumindest jedoch im Europäischen Wirtschaftsraum.Dies gilt sowohl für die Erbringung der Dienstleistung als solche, als auchfür die Datenverarbeitung sowie alle weiteren Schritte, die für die Erbringungder Dienstleistung erforderlich sind. Die EU und der EWR sind durch eine hoheRechtsstaatlichkeit geprägt. Zudem agieren dort starke Institutionen, die sichinsbesondere für die Wahrung von Menschenrechten einsetzen. Dies trägt inerheblichem Maße zur Minimierung etwaiger Menschenrechtsverletzungen undUmweltrisiken bei.Ergänzend wurden die einzelnen Dienstleister jeweils geprüft und hinsichtlichihrer Risikosituation bewertet. Im Einzelfall wurden weitergehende Prüfungenveranlasst.Im eigenen Geschäftsbereich der Generali wurde ein potenziell relevantesRisiko identifiziert (siehe Kapitel I §3). Im Berichtszeitraum wurden keineRisiken bei mittelbaren Zulieferern identifiziert, da uns keine Hinweise aufeine Risikolage vorlagen und diesbezüglich keine Beschwerden eingingen.Weitere Einzelheiten sind dem jährlichen Bericht zu entnehmen.6\\\\. ABHILFEMASSNAHMEN BEI VERSTÖSSEN UND ANGEMESSENE BESEITIGUNG SOWIEZEITNAHE WIEDERGUTMACHUNGFür den Fall, dass wir als Unternehmen direkt die Verletzung von Menschenoder Umweltrechten verursachen würden, wirken wir schnell darauf hin, dieverursachenden Geschäftsaktivitäten zu unterbinden oder gesetzeskonform zugestalten und wirken auf die Wiedergutmachung hin. Bei Verhalten unsererMitarbeiterinnen und Mitarbeiter, das mit den Menschenrechten nicht vereinbarist, werden entsprechende Konsequenzen eingeleitet.Für den Fall, dass wir durch unsere Geschäftsaktivitäten zu potenziellen odertatsächlichen Menschen und/oder Umweltrechtsverletzungen beitragen oder mitdiesen indirekt in Verbindung stehen, bemühen wir uns, zu einer angemessenenBeseitigung und zeitnahen Wiedergutmachung durch die verantwortlichen Stellenbeizutragen. Liegt uns ein begründeter Verdacht oder konkreter Hinweis übermögliche Menschenrechtsverletzungen in unserem Unternehmen oder entlangunserer Lieferkette vor, gehen wir diesem sorgfältig und konsequent nach. InAbhängigkeit von der Schwere der Verletzung behalten wir uns im Zusammenhangmit unseren Geschäftspartnern angemessene Reaktionsmöglichkeiten von derAufforderung zur unverzüglichen Beseitigung der Verletzung über rechtlicheSchritte bis hin zur Kündigung der Geschäftsbeziehung vor. Unabhängig davonwirken wir auf die Wiedergutmachung der Verletzung hin.Lieferanten/Vertragspartner betreffende Verdachtsmeldungen und Auffälligkeitenkönnen sowohl von Mitarbeiterinnen und Mitarbeitern als auch von Drittendirekt beim Menschenrechtsbeauftragten der Generali adressiert werden. Diediesbezüglichen Zuständigkeiten sind klar geregelt.Liegt ein begründeter Verdacht oder konkreter Hinweis über mögliche Menschenund/oder Umweltrechtsverletzungen durch einen Lieferanten oder dessenSubdienstleister vor, ist der Menschenrechtsbeauftragte in Kooperation mit dementsprechenden Fachbereich verpflichtet, diesem sorgfältig und konsequentnachzugehen. Die unmittelbaren Lieferanten/Vertragspartner werdenaufgefordert, bei der Aufklärung des Sachverhaltes zu unterstützen und ineinem angemessenen Zeitrahmen vollumfänglich zu kooperieren. In Abhängigkeitvon der Schwere der Verletzung wird die Generali anlassbezogen aktiv.7\\\\. BESCHWERDEMECHANISMUSEin angemessenes und wirksames Beschwerdemanagement ist ein wichtigerBestandteil unserer Sorgfaltsprozesse, um möglichen nachteiligenmenschenrechtlichen und umweltbezogenen Auswirkungen durch unser Unternehmenund unsere Geschäftsaktivitäten effektiv vorzubeugen und wirksam Abhilfe zuschaffen. Wir haben ein Beschwerdemanagementverfahren eingerichtet, dasinnerhalb und außerhalb des Unternehmens zugänglich ist.Wir betreiben ein Hinweisgebersystem, das internen und externenInteressengruppen sowie allen potenziell Betroffenen weltweit einenvertraulichen Kommunikationskanal bietet, um mögliche Verstöße gegenMenschenrechte und internationale Abkommen zu melden. Zugangsmöglichkeiten zumHinweisgebersystem werden proaktiv und in angemessener Sprache an dieseGruppen kommuniziert. Meldungen können auch anonym erfolgen.Alle gemeldeten Hinweise und begründeten Verdachtsmomente über möglicheMenschenrechtsverletzungen werden im Rahmen eines Prozesses bearbeitet (sieheVerfahrensordnung). Die Vertraulichkeit und Anonymität von Hinweisgeberinnenund Hinweisgebern wird gewahrt. Die Generali hat sich zum Schutz vonHinweisgebern dazu verpflichtet, ein Arbeitsumfeld zu schaffen, welches freivon Vergeltungsmaßnahmen bzw. Repressalien ist. Dazu gehört auch die Meldungeines Missstandes. Vergeltungsmaßnahmen stellen ein Fehlverhalten dar undwerden durch die Generali Group nicht toleriert. Unser systematischer Umgangmit Beschwerden und den daraus gewonnenen Erkenntnissen ermöglicht es unsdabei, unsere menschenrechtlichen Sorgfaltsprozesse kontinuierlich zuverbessern.8\\\\. JÄHRLICHER LkSGREPORT ERFÜLLT DOKUMENTATIONS UND BERICHTSPFLICHTIn unserem ab 2024 jährlich erscheinenden LkSGReport der Generali DeutschlandAG und ab 2025 der Generali Deutschland Services GmbH informieren wir dieÖffentlichkeit über unsere menschenrechtlichen Selbstverpflichtungen sowieSorgfaltsprozesse und deren Wirksamkeit. Dazu berichten wir über wesentlichevon uns identifizierte menschen und umweltrechtliche Risiken und Auswirkungendurch Geschäftsaktivitäten entlang unserer Lieferketten und beschreiben unsereumgesetzten Initiativen zur Prävention und Abhilfe.

UNSER ANSATZ ZUR UMSETZUNG MENSCHENRECHTLICHER UND UMWELTBEZOGENERSORGFALTSPFLICHTENDie Achtung der Menschen und Umweltrechte gehört seit jeher zu denGrundpfeilern unserer Geschäftsprinzipien und unserer Unternehmenskultur. DieEinhaltung geltender Gesetze, internationaler Standards, ethischerGrundprinzipien wie auch von Selbstverpflichtungen genießt bei uns absolutePriorität. Die Umsetzung menschen und umweltrechtlicher Sorgfaltspflichtenist für uns ein kontinuierlicher Prozess, der stetig überprüft und fortwährendweiterentwickelt wird. Wir haben daher menschen und umweltrechtlicheSorgfaltsprozesse als integrale Bestandteile in unserer Organisation und inden Beziehungen zu unseren Geschäftspartnern verankert.Eine Vielzahl interner Regelwerke unterstützt uns dabei, diesem hohen Anspruchund Selbstverständnis tagtäglich gerecht zu werden. Allem voran ist der Codeof Conduct zu nennen. Als Manifest unserer Identität und unserer Wertedefiniert er die Grundregeln für ein integres Verhalten all unsererMitarbeiterinnen und Mitarbeiter.Die Achtung der Menschen und Umweltrechte geht für uns Hand in Hand mit eineroffenen Kommunikationskultur. Daher verfügen wir über verschiedensteMeldewege, die es ermöglichen, Praktiken und Handlungen, die möglicherweisegegen interne oder externe Regelungen verstoßen, vertraulich zu melden. Diesgilt ganz besonders auch für Diskriminierungen und Belästigungen imArbeitsumfeld. Wir nehmen dieses Thema sehr ernst und setzen uns dafür ein,Diversität und Inklusion als integralen Bestandteil der Unternehmenskultur zuverankern. Wir ermutigen alle Mitarbeiterinnen und Mitarbeiter, jeglichesVerhalten, das dagegen verstößt, zu melden.Wir sind der festen Überzeugung, dass die Achtung der Menschen undUmweltrechte eines ganzheitlichen Ansatzes bedarf. Daher legen wir diese hohenMaßstäbe nicht nur bei uns selbst an, sondern erwarten dies gleichermaßen auchvon unseren Partnern. Insbesondere im Rahmen des Einkaufs achten wir striktdarauf, dass unsere Partner unsere Werte teilen und ebenfalls entsprechendeSchutzmechanismen eingerichtet haben.Die Generali erwartet, dass ihre Lieferanten sicherstellen, dass die von derGenerali formulierten Menschenrechts und Umweltanforderungen nach dem Gesetzüber die Sorgfaltspflicht in der Lieferkette (LkSG) sowohl von den Lieferantenund deren Mitarbeitern als auch von deren Zulieferern eingehalten werden.Generali soll berechtigt sein, Art und Umfang der einzuhaltenden Präventivund Abhilfemaßnahmen zur Umsetzung der Menschenrechts und Umweltanforderungenzu bestimmen und jedem Lieferanten diesbezügliche Anweisungen zu erteilen.Insbesondere werden die Lieferanten aufgefordert, Schulungen undWeiterbildungen durchzuführen, um die Anforderungen zu erfüllen. Die Generaliund ihre externen Auditoren sollen berechtigt sein, die Einhaltung derMenschenrechts und Umweltanforderungen im Rahmen ihrer Befugnisse zuüberprüfen.2\\\\. VERANTWORTLICHKEITEN FÜR DIE MENSCHEN UND UMWELTRECHTLICHENSORGFALTSPFLICHTEN BEI GENERALIFür die Wahrnehmung und Einhaltung unserer menschen und umweltrechtlichenSorgfaltspflichten haben wir klare Verantwortlichkeiten definiert. In derGenerali nimmt der Head of Sustainability die Position desMenschenrechtsbeauftragten ein und ist für die Achtung der Menschen undUmweltrechte im Rahmen aller relevanten Geschäftsaktivitäten sowie in unsererLieferkette verantwortlich. In dieser Funktion berichtet derMenschenrechtsbeauftragte direkt an die Geschäftsleitung und stelltinsbesondere die Überwachung des Risikomanagements sicher.3\\\\. BEKENNTNIS ZUR KONTINUIERLICHEN WEITERENTWICKLUNG UNSERERMENSCHENRECHTLICHEN SORGFALTSPROZESSEDie Achtung der Menschenrechte und die Umsetzung menschenrechtlicher undumweltbezogener Sorgfaltspflichten in unseren betrieblichen Prozessen ist füruns ein wichtiger Beitrag zur Verbesserung der menschenrechtlichen Lageentlang der globalen Lieferketten.

MENSCHENRECHTESeit dem Jahr 2023 verpflichtet das deutscheLieferkettensorgfaltspflichtengesetz (LkSG) auch Versicherungen, in ihrenLieferketten menschenrechtliche und umweltbezogene Sorgfaltspflichten inangemessener Weise zu beachten. Ziel ist es, menschenrechtlichen undumweltbezogenen Risiken vorzubeugen bzw. sie zu minimieren und die Verletzungmenschenrechtsbezogener oder umweltbezogener Pflichten zu beenden. Das LkSGverpflichtet Unternehmen zudem zur Abgabe einer Grundsatzerklärung.  Die Generali in Deutschland hat zum 1. Januar 2023 die Umsetzung für dieGenerali Deutschland AG und zum 1. Januar 2024 für Generali DeutschlandServices GmbH entsprechend den gesetzlichen Vorgaben vorgenommen. Über diegesetzliche Verpflichtung hinaus wurden grundsätzlich alle deutschenTochtergesellschaften im Rahmen der LkSGUmsetzung einbezogen. Generali in Deutschland umfasst in der Regel GeneraliGesellschaften, die in Deutschland ihren Hauptsitz haben. Dazu gehören z.B. auch die Marken Cosmos Direkt oder Dialog mit ihren jeweiligen Versicherungsunternehmen und die Generali Deutschland Services GmbH.

ACHTUNG DER MENSCHENRECHTEDie Generali in Deutschland (im Folgenden: Generali) ist sich ihrerunternehmerischen Verantwortung zur Achtung der Menschen und Umweltrechtebewusst. Wir verpflichten uns, menschenrechtliche und umweltbezogeneSorgfaltspflichten in unseren Lieferketten in angemessener Weise zuberücksichtigen und Betroffenen von entsprechenden Verstößen Zugang zu Abhilfezu ermöglichen. Dabei richten wir unser unternehmerisches Handeln aninternational anerkannten Leitprinzipien für Wirtschaft und Menschenrechte derVereinten Nationen aus und setzen somit die Anforderungen des NationalenAktionsplans für Wirtschaft und Menschenrechte und des deutschenLieferkettensorgfaltspflichtengesetzes um.Unser Verständnis und unsere menschenrechtlichen Standards beruhen auffolgenden international anerkannten Grundsätzen:   Die Internationale Menschenrechtscharta, d.h. die Allgemeine Erklärung der Menschenrechte der Vereinten Nationen sowie der Zivilpakt und der Sozialpakt, in denen bürgerliche, politische und soziale Rechte definiert sind, die allen Menschen um ihrer Würde willen zustehen.   Die Kernarbeitsnormen der Internationalen Arbeitsorganisation (ILO) mit ihren fünf Grundprinzipien zu Vereinigungsfreiheit und Recht auf Kollektivverhandlungen, der Beseitigung von Zwangsarbeit, der Abschaffung von Kinderarbeit sowie dem Verbot der Diskriminierung in Beschäftigung und Beruf sowie Arbeitsschutz und Arbeitssicherheit.Darüber hinaus unterstützen wir die in der Initiative UN Global Compactfestgelegten Prinzipien zu Menschen und Arbeitsrechten; in Bezug aufspezifische internationale Standards im Versicherungssektor hat dieinternationale Generali Group die Prinzipien für verantwortungsvollesInvestieren (PRI) und die Prinzipien für nachhaltige Versicherungen (PSI)unterzeichnet. Beide Initiativen wurden von den Vereinten Nationen ins Lebengerufen und unterstützt.2\\\\. UNSER VORGEHENDas Bekenntnis zu den genannten Abkommen und Grundsätzen sowie internenDokumente der internationalen Generali Group tragen dazu bei, die Achtung derMenschen und Umweltrechte angemessen in unseren Lieferketten zugewährleisten. Gleichzeitig stellen sie unsere umwelt undmenschenrechtsbezogenen Erwartungen an uns, unsere Mitarbeiterinnen undMitarbeiter und unsere Lieferanten und Vertragspartner im Sinne des LkSG (imFolgenden: „Lieferanten/Vertragspartner“) dar. Die Verpflichtung zurangemessenen Berücksichtigung entsprechender Rechte ergibt sich insbesondereauch aus den nachfolgend aufgelisteten internen Dokumenten:   Code of Conduct (Verhaltenskodex)   Integration of Sustainability into Investments and Active Ownership Guideline   Responsible Underwriting Group Guideline   Ethical Code for Suppliers (EthikKodex für Lieferanten der Generali Gruppe)   Sustainability Group Guideline (KonzernNachhaltigkeitsrichtlinie)   Deutsche Nachhaltigkeitsrichtlinie   Generali Group´s Charter of Sustainability Commitments (Nachhaltigkeitscharta der internationalen Generali Group)   Europäischen SozialchartaDie internationale Generali Group hat in ihrer „Human Rights Strategy“detailliert ihre Haltung zu Menschenrechten dargelegt.Unter Nachhaltigkeitsstrategie und Nachhaltigkeit & Verantwortung finden Sieumfangreiche Informationen über Ambitionen, Haltung und Maßnahmen der Generaliin Deutschland.3\\\\. UNSERE MITARBEITERINNEN UND MITARBEITERWir bieten ein Arbeitsumfeld, das frei von jeglicher Form von Diskriminierung,Belästigung, Einschüchterung oder Mobbing ist, und wir fördern Vielfalt undInklusion, weil wir glauben, dass die Zusammenarbeit zwischen Menschen mitunterschiedlichen Fähigkeiten, Perspektiven, Hintergründen und Kulturen einSchlüsselelement für die Geschäftstätigkeit ist.Wir erkennen auch das Recht unserer Mitarbeiterinnen und Mitarbeiter aufVereinigungsfreiheit und Kollektivverhandlungen an und dulden keine Form vonillegaler Arbeit oder Ausbeutung, Zwangs und Kinderarbeit.Die Grundrechte der Arbeitnehmer werden auch in der Europäischen Sozialcharta,die in Zusammenarbeit mit dem Europäischen Betriebsrat des Konzernsausgearbeitet wurde, im Verhaltenskodex und in der Nachhaltigkeitscharta derinternationalen Generali Group bekräftigt.4\\\\. UNSERE LIEFERANTEN/VERTRAGSPARTNERUm ein verantwortungsbewusstes Handeln entlang unserer Lieferkette unterangemessener Einhaltung der Grundsätze der Menschen und Umweltrechte zugewährleisten, verlangt die Generali von ihren Vertragspartnern (Lieferanten,Dienstleister und Kooperationspartner), dass sie auf allen Ebenen ihrerLieferkette die in den Konzernleitlinien festgelegten Grundsätze respektieren,wie zum Beispiel den Ethikkodex für Lieferanten der internationalen GeneraliGroup und den Code of Conduct sowie die wichtigsten nationalen undinternationalen Standards, beispielsweise die Grundkonvention derInternationalen Arbeitsorganisation (ILO) und die Allgemeine Erklärung derMenschenrechte der Vereinten Nationen.Wir gestalten die Beziehungen zu unseren Vertragspartnernverantwortungsbewusst – wir lehnen moderne Sklaverei und Menschenhandel in allihren Formen ab und tolerieren sie nicht in unserer Lieferkette. Die Generaligewährleistet ein effektives und effizientes Beschaffungsmanagement, indem dieBeschaffung von Dienstleistungen und Gütern klar im Rahmen einerEinkaufsrichtlinie strukturiert wird. Demnach sind alle Beschaffungsvorgängebis auf definierte Ausnahmen, über den international sowie nationalaufgestellten Einkauf abzubilden. Durch die Integration externerKooperationspartner wird im Unternehmensbereich Schaden der Generali eineffektives und effizientes sowie kundenorientiertes Schadenmanagementsichergestellt. Der Anbindungsprozess von externen Kooperationspartnern unddie diesbezüglichen Verantwortlichkeiten sind in einer entsprechendenLeitlinie geregelt. Kooperationspartner im Kontext des Schadenmanagements derGenerali sind Lieferanten/Vertragspartner im Sinne des LkSG und fallen indessen Anwendungsbereich. Die zur Wahrung von Menschenrechten und Minimierungvon Umweltrisiken notwendigen Sorgfaltsprozesse im Kontext vonBeschaffungsvorgängen und Kooperationspartnern des UnternehmensbereichsSchaden werden kontinuierlich weiterentwickelt und an veränderte Bedingungenangepasst.  I. Ver\\xadfah\\xadren zur Wah\\xadrung der Pflich\\xadten1\\\\. ANGEMESSENES UND WIRKSAMES RISIKOMANAGEMENTDie Generali hat ein etabliertes GovernanceSystem (Geschäftsorganisation) zumManagement aller relevanten Risiken (unter anderem Umwelt undMenschenrechtsrisiken) eingerichtet, welches eine solide und umsichtigeLeitung jedes Konzernunternehmens gewährleistet. Kernbestandteile derGeschäftsorganisation sind das Risikomanagementsystem (RMS), das interneKontrollsystem (IKS) sowie die vier unabhängigen Kontrollfunktionen –RisikomanagementFunktion (RMF), ComplianceFunktion (CF), Funktion derInternen Revision (IRF) und Versicherungsmathematische Funktion (VMF). Das RMSist so gestaltet, dass die Identifikation, Bewertung, Überwachung, Minderungund Berichterstattung der eingegangenen und potenziellen Risiken sowie derenAggregation unter Berücksichtigung der Abhängigkeiten jederzeit möglich sind.Das IKS ist der zweite Kernbestandteil des GovernanceSystems und umfasstAspekte, wie zum Beispiel Internes Kontrollumfeld, Interne Kontrollmaßnahmen,Kontrollbewusstsein sowie Überwachung und Berichterstattung. Das IKS folgt derSystematik der „Three Lines of Defense”. Hier bilden die klassischenManagementkontrollen (einschließlich derer durch denMenschenrechtsbeauftragten – siehe Kapitel II, §2) die ersteVerteidigungslinie; die RMF, die CF und die VMF befinden sich auf der zweitenEbene, und die unabhängige Überwachung durch die Konzernrevision stellt diedritte Verteidigungslinie dar.2\\\\. PRIORISIERUNG VON MENSCHENRECHTS UND UMWELTRISIKENWir bekennen uns zur Achtung aller international anerkannten Menschenrechtesowie internationalen Umweltkonventionen und legen den Fokus unserermenschenrechtlichen und umweltbezogenen Sorgfaltsprozesse gemäß § 2 Absatz 2und 3 Lieferkettensorgfaltspflichtengesetz auf folgende Menschenrechts undumweltbezogene Themen.Menschenrechtsrisiken:   Verstoß gegen das Verbot von Kinderarbeit   Verstoß gegen das Verbot von Zwangsarbeit und aller Formen der Sklaverei   Missachtung von Arbeitsschutz und arbeitsbedingten Gesundheitsgefahren   Missachtung der Koalitionsfreiheit, Vereinigungsfreiheit und Recht auf Kollektivverhandlungen   Verstoß gegen das Verbot der Ungleichbehandlung in Beschäftigung   Verstoß gegen das Verbot des Vorenthaltens eines angemessenen Lohns   Zerstörung der natürlichen Lebensgrundlage durch Umweltverunreinigungen   Widerrechtliche Verletzung von Landrechten   Verstoß gegen das Verbot der Beauftragung oder Nutzung privater/öffentlicher Sicherheitskräfte, die aufgrund mangelnder Unterweisung oder Kontrolle zu Beeinträchtigungen führen können   Verstoß gegen das Verbot eines Tuns oder pflichtwidrigen Unterlassens, das unmittelbar geeignet ist, in besonders schwerwiegender Weise eine geschützte Rechtsposition (das heißt weitere Menschenrechte) zu beeinträchtigen und dessen Rechtswidrigkeit bei verständiger Würdigung aller in Betracht kommenden Umstände offensichtlich istUmweltbezogene Risiken:   Verstoß gegen ein aus dem MinamataÜbereinkommen resultierendes Verbot (das MinamataÜbereinkommen ist ein völkerrechtlicher Vertrag aus dem Jahr 2013, mit dem die Emissionen und Freisetzungen des Schwermetalls Quecksilber eingedämmt werden sollen)   Verstoß gegen das Verbot der Produktion und/oder Verwendung von Stoffen im Anwendungsbereich der StockholmKonvention (POP) sowie nicht umweltgerechter Umgang mit POPhaltigen Abfällen   Verstoß gegen das Verbot der Ein und Ausfuhr gefährlicher Abfälle im Sinne des Basler ÜbereinkommensDie bisher durchgeführten Risikobewertungen im eigenen Geschäftsbereich undbei Lieferanten ergaben kein konkretes hohes Risiko, das einer Priorisierungund anschließenden Abhilfemaßnahmen erforderlich machen würde (siehe Abschnitt5).Im Übrigen wurde im eigenen Geschäftsbereich ein potenziell relevantes Risikohinsichtlich „Ungleichbehandlung im Beschäftigungsbereich“ festgestellt. Eswerden derzeit Maßnahmen zur Bewältigung und Minimierung dieses Risikosergriffen.Darüber hinaus wurden die Risiken analysiert, die von den Ländern und Branchenausgehen, in denen die Lieferanten des Unternehmens tätig sind. Infolgedessenfielen bestimmte Lieferanten in die Kategorie „mittleres Risiko“ und für siewerden vorbeugende Maßnahmen ergriffen.3\\\\. RISIKOMINIMIERUNG DURCH PRÄVENTIONSMASSNAHMEN IM EIGENEN GESCHÄFTSBEREICHWir überprüfen mindestens einmal jährlich sowie anlassbezogen, wiewirkungsvoll unsere bereits in der Präambel und nachfolgend beschriebenenMaßnahmen sind, um nachteilige menschenrechtliche Auswirkungen zu verhüten undabzumildern. Zudem prüfen wir, ob unsere Vorgaben eingehalten werden.Innerhalb unseres Unternehmens schulen wir gezielt die Mitarbeiterinnen undMitarbeiter, die regelmäßig mit Lieferanten/Vertragspartnern im Kontakt sind.Information und Sensibilisierung aller relevanten Mitarbeiterinnen undMitarbeiter sind erfolgt. Wir prüfen die Effektivität von Maßnahmen, indem wirdie Ergebnisse unserer kontinuierlichen Analyse menschenrechtlicher undumweltbezogener Risiken und Auswirkungen beobachten, analysieren,gegebenenfalls Präventionsmaßnahmen zu ergreifen (zum Beispiel Audits) undMissstände beheben. Um für unsere Geschäftspartner und für die Öffentlichkeitinsgesamt größtmögliche Transparenz hinsichtlich unserer eigenen Maßnahmen zuRisikominimierung zu bieten, haben wir ausführliche Antworten auf eineRisikoanalyse der spezialisierten Agentur Integrity Next hinterlegt. DieAntworten sind im OnlineUnternehmensprofil verfügbar und werden regelmäßigergänzt bzw. aktualisiert.Im eigenen Geschäftsbereich wurde im Jahr 2023 ein potenziell relevantesRisiko identifiziert. Das Risiko besteht in der möglichen Verletzung derGleichbehandlung und Chancengleichheit der Mitarbeiter des Unternehmens. DasUnternehmen beschloss, diesem potenziellen Risiko durch verschiedenevorbeugende Maßnahmen zu begegnen, darunter:   Eine geschlechtsunabhängige, faire und leistungsorientierte Bezahlung. Die Branchentarifverträge für die private Versicherungswirtschaft, die auch bei der Generali in Deutschland Anwendung finden, sind die Grundlage für eine geschlechtsunabhängige Vergütung im Tarifbereich   Seit 2019 wird mindestens einmal jährlich eine Gender/ Equal Pay Gap Analyse durchgeführt, um geschlechterspezifische Gehaltsunterschiede zu ermitteln, mit dem Ziel, etwaige historisch bedingte Gehaltsdifferenzen auf gleicher fachlicher Ebene zu schließen   Im Hinblick auf Gender Diversity ist die kontinuierliche Steigerung des Anteils der weiblichen Führungskräfte auf allen hierarchischen Ebenen ein zentrales Ziel   Women Mentoring Programme   AwarenessVeranstaltungen4\\\\. PRÄVENTIONSMASSNAHMEN GEGENÜBER UNMITTELBAREN LIEFERANTEN/VERTRAGSPARTNERIm Vorfeld einer neuen Vertragsbeziehung werden potenzielle Vertragspartner imRahmen eines geordneten Auswahlprozesses, welcher in der Einkaufsrichtliniestrukturiert, dokumentiert ist, ganzheitlich betrachtet und hinsichtlich derErfüllung fachlicher und technischer Anforderungen, der Wirtschaftlichkeitsowie der Nachhaltigkeit bewertet. Bei der Auswahl der Vertragspartner sindESGKriterien (ESG bedeutet Environmental, Social, Governance) hinterlegt, diesukzessive weiter ausgebaut und systematisiert werden.Zusätzlich zu den Regeln, die im Abschnitt \"Präambel  UnsereLieferanten/Vertragspartner\" aufgeführt sind, verlangt Generali von ihrenLieferanten/Vertragspartnern, dass sie sicherstellen:   Die Einhaltung der im Lieferkettensorgfaltspflichtengesetz formulierten menschenrechts und umweltbezogenen Anforderungen, auch durch Mitarbeiterinnen und Mitarbeiter und Zulieferer des unmittelbaren Lieferanten/Vertragspartners   Die Durchführung von Schulungen und Weiterbildungen zur Einhaltung der Anforderungen   Die Einräumung von Prüfungsrechten an die Generali, welche diese bei Kenntnis eines Risikos oder potenziellen Risikos ausüben darfAusnahmen sind möglich und werden auf der Grundlage der Ergebnisse derRisikobewertung nach den Vorgaben des LkSG gewährt.5\\\\. JÄHRLICHE ÜBERPRÜFUNG DER RISIKOLAGEWir erachten es als Bestandteil unserer Sorgfaltspflicht, potenziell undtatsächlich nachteilige menschenrechtliche und umweltbezogene Risiken undAuswirkungen unseres unternehmerischen Handelns auf Menschen und Umwelt zukennen. Daher ermitteln und bewerten wir mithilfe einer jährlichenRisikobewertung (bzw. anlassbezogen) die relevanten Menschenrechts undUmweltthemen unserer relevanten Geschäftstätigkeit sowie unserer direkten undindirekten Geschäftsbeziehungen. In diesem Prozess berücksichtigen wir auchmenschenrechtliche und umweltbezogene Informationen/ Hinweise von Dritten undgemeldete Vorfälle. Dazu beziehen wir in und externes menschenrechtliches undumweltbezogenes Expertenwissen, Geschäftspartner sowie ausgewählte Stakeholderein.Die Ergebnisse der Analyse menschenrechtlicher und umweltbezogener Risiken undAuswirkungen fließen in unsere unternehmerischen Entscheidungsprozesse inBezug auf die Lieferantenauswahl, das Geschäftspartnermanagement sowie dieProduktverantwortung und entwicklung ein. Die Risikoanalyse bildet dabei dieGrundlage für die Identifikation angemessener Maßnahmen. Darüber hinaus nutzenwir die Ergebnisse als Grundlage zur Erstellung und, wo nötig, Anpassunginterner Vorschriften, Prozesse und Schulungen, um den sich veränderndenAnforderungen an unsere Sorgfaltsprozesse Rechnung zu tragen.Im Jahr 2023 wurden für die Generali und ihre Dienstleister keinediesbezüglichen hohen Risiken oder Verstöße identifiziert, die entsprechenderAbhilfemaßnahmen erforderten.Die Generali ist in der Finanzdienstleistungsbranche tätig. Schon nach der Artder Dienstleistung ist das Risiko eines Verstoßes gegen menschen oderumweltrechtliche Sorgfaltspflichten daher als sehr gering einzustufen. Auchdas Länderrisiko ist als sehr gering einzustufen. Die Generali ist imWesentlichen in der Bundesrepublik Deutschland tätig. Auch ihre unmittelbarenLieferanten/Vertragspartner erbringen ihre Dienstleistung überwiegend in derBundesrepublik Deutschland, zumindest jedoch im Europäischen Wirtschaftsraum.Dies gilt sowohl für die Erbringung der Dienstleistung als solche, als auchfür die Datenverarbeitung sowie alle weiteren Schritte, die für die Erbringungder Dienstleistung erforderlich sind. Die EU und der EWR sind durch eine hoheRechtsstaatlichkeit geprägt. Zudem agieren dort starke Institutionen, die sichinsbesondere für die Wahrung von Menschenrechten einsetzen. Dies trägt inerheblichem Maße zur Minimierung etwaiger Menschenrechtsverletzungen undUmweltrisiken bei.Ergänzend wurden die einzelnen Dienstleister jeweils geprüft und hinsichtlichihrer Risikosituation bewertet. Im Einzelfall wurden weitergehende Prüfungenveranlasst.Im eigenen Geschäftsbereich der Generali wurde ein potenziell relevantesRisiko identifiziert (siehe Kapitel I §3). Im Berichtszeitraum wurden keineRisiken bei mittelbaren Zulieferern identifiziert, da uns keine Hinweise aufeine Risikolage vorlagen und diesbezüglich keine Beschwerden eingingen.Weitere Einzelheiten sind dem jährlichen Bericht zu entnehmen.6\\\\. ABHILFEMASSNAHMEN BEI VERSTÖSSEN UND ANGEMESSENE BESEITIGUNG SOWIEZEITNAHE WIEDERGUTMACHUNGFür den Fall, dass wir als Unternehmen direkt die Verletzung von Menschenoder Umweltrechten verursachen würden, wirken wir schnell darauf hin, dieverursachenden Geschäftsaktivitäten zu unterbinden oder gesetzeskonform zugestalten und wirken auf die Wiedergutmachung hin. Bei Verhalten unsererMitarbeiterinnen und Mitarbeiter, das mit den Menschenrechten nicht vereinbarist, werden entsprechende Konsequenzen eingeleitet.Für den Fall, dass wir durch unsere Geschäftsaktivitäten zu potenziellen odertatsächlichen Menschen und/oder Umweltrechtsverletzungen beitragen oder mitdiesen indirekt in Verbindung stehen, bemühen wir uns, zu einer angemessenenBeseitigung und zeitnahen Wiedergutmachung durch die verantwortlichen Stellenbeizutragen. Liegt uns ein begründeter Verdacht oder konkreter Hinweis übermögliche Menschenrechtsverletzungen in unserem Unternehmen oder entlangunserer Lieferkette vor, gehen wir diesem sorgfältig und konsequent nach. InAbhängigkeit von der Schwere der Verletzung behalten wir uns im Zusammenhangmit unseren Geschäftspartnern angemessene Reaktionsmöglichkeiten von derAufforderung zur unverzüglichen Beseitigung der Verletzung über rechtlicheSchritte bis hin zur Kündigung der Geschäftsbeziehung vor. Unabhängig davonwirken wir auf die Wiedergutmachung der Verletzung hin.Lieferanten/Vertragspartner betreffende Verdachtsmeldungen und Auffälligkeitenkönnen sowohl von Mitarbeiterinnen und Mitarbeitern als auch von Drittendirekt beim Menschenrechtsbeauftragten der Generali adressiert werden. Diediesbezüglichen Zuständigkeiten sind klar geregelt.Liegt ein begründeter Verdacht oder konkreter Hinweis über mögliche Menschenund/oder Umweltrechtsverletzungen durch einen Lieferanten oder dessenSubdienstleister vor, ist der Menschenrechtsbeauftragte in Kooperation mit dementsprechenden Fachbereich verpflichtet, diesem sorgfältig und konsequentnachzugehen. Die unmittelbaren Lieferanten/Vertragspartner werdenaufgefordert, bei der Aufklärung des Sachverhaltes zu unterstützen und ineinem angemessenen Zeitrahmen vollumfänglich zu kooperieren. In Abhängigkeitvon der Schwere der Verletzung wird die Generali anlassbezogen aktiv.7\\\\. BESCHWERDEMECHANISMUSEin angemessenes und wirksames Beschwerdemanagement ist ein wichtigerBestandteil unserer Sorgfaltsprozesse, um möglichen nachteiligenmenschenrechtlichen und umweltbezogenen Auswirkungen durch unser Unternehmenund unsere Geschäftsaktivitäten effektiv vorzubeugen und wirksam Abhilfe zuschaffen. Wir haben ein Beschwerdemanagementverfahren eingerichtet, dasinnerhalb und außerhalb des Unternehmens zugänglich ist.Wir betreiben ein Hinweisgebersystem, das internen und externenInteressengruppen sowie allen potenziell Betroffenen weltweit einenvertraulichen Kommunikationskanal bietet, um mögliche Verstöße gegenMenschenrechte und internationale Abkommen zu melden. Zugangsmöglichkeiten zumHinweisgebersystem werden proaktiv und in angemessener Sprache an dieseGruppen kommuniziert. Meldungen können auch anonym erfolgen.Alle gemeldeten Hinweise und begründeten Verdachtsmomente über möglicheMenschenrechtsverletzungen werden im Rahmen eines Prozesses bearbeitet (sieheVerfahrensordnung). Die Vertraulichkeit und Anonymität von Hinweisgeberinnenund Hinweisgebern wird gewahrt. Die Generali hat sich zum Schutz vonHinweisgebern dazu verpflichtet, ein Arbeitsumfeld zu schaffen, welches freivon Vergeltungsmaßnahmen bzw. Repressalien ist. Dazu gehört auch die Meldungeines Missstandes. Vergeltungsmaßnahmen stellen ein Fehlverhalten dar undwerden durch die Generali Group nicht toleriert. Unser systematischer Umgangmit Beschwerden und den daraus gewonnenen Erkenntnissen ermöglicht es unsdabei, unsere menschenrechtlichen Sorgfaltsprozesse kontinuierlich zuverbessern.8\\\\. JÄHRLICHER LkSGREPORT ERFÜLLT DOKUMENTATIONS UND BERICHTSPFLICHTIn unserem ab 2024 jährlich erscheinenden LkSGReport der Generali DeutschlandAG und ab 2025 der Generali Deutschland Services GmbH informieren wir dieÖffentlichkeit über unsere menschenrechtlichen Selbstverpflichtungen sowieSorgfaltsprozesse und deren Wirksamkeit. Dazu berichten wir über wesentlichevon uns identifizierte menschen und umweltrechtliche Risiken und Auswirkungendurch Geschäftsaktivitäten entlang unserer Lieferketten und beschreiben unsereumgesetzten Initiativen zur Prävention und Abhilfe.

UNSER ANSATZ ZUR UMSETZUNG MENSCHENRECHTLICHER UND UMWELTBEZOGENERSORGFALTSPFLICHTENDie Achtung der Menschen und Umweltrechte gehört seit jeher zu denGrundpfeilern unserer Geschäftsprinzipien und unserer Unternehmenskultur. DieEinhaltung geltender Gesetze, internationaler Standards, ethischerGrundprinzipien wie auch von Selbstverpflichtungen genießt bei uns absolutePriorität. Die Umsetzung menschen und umweltrechtlicher Sorgfaltspflichtenist für uns ein kontinuierlicher Prozess, der stetig überprüft und fortwährendweiterentwickelt wird. Wir haben daher menschen und umweltrechtlicheSorgfaltsprozesse als integrale Bestandteile in unserer Organisation und inden Beziehungen zu unseren Geschäftspartnern verankert.Eine Vielzahl interner Regelwerke unterstützt uns dabei, diesem hohen Anspruchund Selbstverständnis tagtäglich gerecht zu werden. Allem voran ist der Codeof Conduct zu nennen. Als Manifest unserer Identität und unserer Wertedefiniert er die Grundregeln für ein integres Verhalten all unsererMitarbeiterinnen und Mitarbeiter.Die Achtung der Menschen und Umweltrechte geht für uns Hand in Hand mit eineroffenen Kommunikationskultur. Daher verfügen wir über verschiedensteMeldewege, die es ermöglichen, Praktiken und Handlungen, die möglicherweisegegen interne oder externe Regelungen verstoßen, vertraulich zu melden. Diesgilt ganz besonders auch für Diskriminierungen und Belästigungen imArbeitsumfeld. Wir nehmen dieses Thema sehr ernst und setzen uns dafür ein,Diversität und Inklusion als integralen Bestandteil der Unternehmenskultur zuverankern. Wir ermutigen alle Mitarbeiterinnen und Mitarbeiter, jeglichesVerhalten, das dagegen verstößt, zu melden.Wir sind der festen Überzeugung, dass die Achtung der Menschen undUmweltrechte eines ganzheitlichen Ansatzes bedarf. Daher legen wir diese hohenMaßstäbe nicht nur bei uns selbst an, sondern erwarten dies gleichermaßen auchvon unseren Partnern. Insbesondere im Rahmen des Einkaufs achten wir striktdarauf, dass unsere Partner unsere Werte teilen und ebenfalls entsprechendeSchutzmechanismen eingerichtet haben.Die Generali erwartet, dass ihre Lieferanten sicherstellen, dass die von derGenerali formulierten Menschenrechts und Umweltanforderungen nach dem Gesetzüber die Sorgfaltspflicht in der Lieferkette (LkSG) sowohl von den Lieferantenund deren Mitarbeitern als auch von deren Zulieferern eingehalten werden.Generali soll berechtigt sein, Art und Umfang der einzuhaltenden Präventivund Abhilfemaßnahmen zur Umsetzung der Menschenrechts und Umweltanforderungenzu bestimmen und jedem Lieferanten diesbezügliche Anweisungen zu erteilen.Insbesondere werden die Lieferanten aufgefordert, Schulungen undWeiterbildungen durchzuführen, um die Anforderungen zu erfüllen. Die Generaliund ihre externen Auditoren sollen berechtigt sein, die Einhaltung derMenschenrechts und Umweltanforderungen im Rahmen ihrer Befugnisse zuüberprüfen.2\\\\. VERANTWORTLICHKEITEN FÜR DIE MENSCHEN UND UMWELTRECHTLICHENSORGFALTSPFLICHTEN BEI GENERALIFür die Wahrnehmung und Einhaltung unserer menschen und umweltrechtlichenSorgfaltspflichten haben wir klare Verantwortlichkeiten definiert. In derGenerali nimmt der Head of Sustainability die Position desMenschenrechtsbeauftragten ein und ist für die Achtung der Menschen undUmweltrechte im Rahmen aller relevanten Geschäftsaktivitäten sowie in unsererLieferkette verantwortlich. In dieser Funktion berichtet derMenschenrechtsbeauftragte direkt an die Geschäftsleitung und stelltinsbesondere die Überwachung des Risikomanagements sicher.3\\\\. BEKENNTNIS ZUR KONTINUIERLICHEN WEITERENTWICKLUNG UNSERERMENSCHENRECHTLICHEN SORGFALTSPROZESSEDie Achtung der Menschenrechte und die Umsetzung menschenrechtlicher undumweltbezogener Sorgfaltspflichten in unseren betrieblichen Prozessen ist füruns ein wichtiger Beitrag zur Verbesserung der menschenrechtlichen Lageentlang der globalen Lieferketten. Wir nehmen diese Herausforderung an undtreten dafür ein, unsere menschenrechtlichen und umweltbezogenenSorgfaltsprozesse kontinuierlich weiterzuentwickeln.

Ferner regelt der Zusatzfür Verantwortliche insbesondere:   das Erfordernis einer Rechtsgrundlage für die gemeinsame Verarbeitung (mit der Maßgabe, dass die Verantwortlichkeit hierfür Facebook Ireland und uns jeweils hinsichtlich der eigenen Verarbeitung trifft),   die Verantwortlichkeit für das Widerspruchsrecht nach Art. 21 DSGVO, soweit die gemeinsame Verarbeitung auf Artikel 6(1) lit. f DSGVO basiert (ebenfalls mit der Maßgabe, dass die Verantwortlichkeit hierfür Facebook Ireland und uns jeweils hinsichtlich der eigenen Verarbeitung trifft),   Artikel 33 u. 34 DSGVO: Die Verantwortlichkeiten bei Verletzungen des Schutzes personenbezogener Daten im Zusammenhang mit der gemeinsamen Verarbeitung,   die Verantwortlichkeit für die Meldung von Verletzungen des Schutzes personenbezogener Daten an die Aufsichtsbehörde (Art. 33 DSGVO) und für die Benachrichtigung der von einer Verletzung des Schutzes personenbezogener Daten betroffenen Person (Art. 34 DSGVO) in Abhängigkeit davon, ob eine Verletzung des Schutzes personenbezogener Daten die Verpflichtungen von Facebook Ireland oder von uns betrifft.Weitere Informationen dazu, wie Facebook Ireland personenbezogene Datenverarbeitet, einschließlich der Rechtsgrundlage, auf die Facebook Ireland sichdabei stützt, der Möglichkeiten zur Wahrnehmung der Rechte betroffenerPersonen gegenüber Facebook Ireland und zu den gemäß Artikel 13 Abs. 1 lit. a)und b) DSGVO erforderlichen Informationen finden Sie in denDatenschutzhinweisen von Facebook Ireland unterhttps://www.facebook.com/about/privacy/.  Hin\\xadweise zur Daten\\xadsi\\xadcher\\xadheitUnsere Sicherheitsvorkehrungen entsprechen dem aktuellen Stand der Technik: Geschützter ZugangAls InternetNutzer haben Sie freien Zugang zu allen öffentlichen Seiten derdeutschen Generali Gruppe. Neben diesen öffentlichen Bereichen gibt esgeschützte Bereiche, die bestimmten Benutzergruppen vorbehalten sind. DieseBereiche erfordern eine Anmeldung durch den Benutzer. Da die in diesenBereichen zugänglichen Daten schützenswert sein können, ist ein sorgfältigerUmgang mit den zur Anmeldung benötigten Informationen (insbes. Kennwörter)notwendig. Umgang mit KennwörternEin gutes Kennwort sollte mindestens 8 Zeichen lang sein, keine Namen oderWörter enthalten und sich aus Buchstaben, Ziffern und Sonderzeichenzusammensetzen. Es sollte nicht auf Ihrem PC oder im Browser gespeichertwerden. Ausführlichere Informationen zum Umgang mit Kennwörtern hat dasBundesamt für Sicherheit in der Informationstechnik (BSI) zusammengestellt. Übertragung sensibler DatenWenn Sie innerhalb unseres Internetangebots Seiten mit der Möglichkeit zurDateneingabe aufrufen und aufgefordert werden, Daten über sich einzugeben undabzuschicken, verwenden wir beim Versenden dieser Daten zur Datenübertragungüber das Internet die Verschlüsselungstechnik SSL (Secure Socket Layer) miteiner Schlüssellänge von mindestens 128Bit. Bis heute sind keineMöglichkeiten zur analytischen Entschlüsselung einer solchen 128BitVerschlüsselung bekannt. Den Einsatz von SSL können Sie u. a. an der Adressebzw. URL (die in einem solchen Fall mit HTTPS beginnt) oder an dem Schloss inder Statusleiste Ihres Webbrowsers erkennen. EMailsMitteilungen, die personenbezogene Daten enthalten, versenden wir nichtunverschlüsselt per EMail.  Sollten Sie selbst unverschlüsselte EMails an uns versenden, beachten Sie,dass diese bei der Übertragung im Internet nicht gegen Kenntnisnahme oderManipulation durch unbefugte Dritte geschützt sind.  Bevor Sie uns eine EMail schicken, bedenken Sie bitte, dass deren Inhalt imInternet nicht gegen unbefugte Kenntnisnahme, Verfälschung usw. geschützt ist.Aus diesem Grund ist es empfehlenswert ein Kontaktformular zu nutzen, wenn Sieeine Nachricht an die Generali Deutschland Krankenversicherung AG, dieGenerali Deutschland Lebensversicherung AG oder die Generali DeutschlandVersicherung AG schicken möchten. PhishingPhishingBetrüger fälschen EMails und Internetseiten, um an Ihrevertraulichen Daten wie bspw. Passwörter oder sonstige sensible Datenheranzukommen. Bitte beachten Sie, dass wir niemals EMails oder SMSverschicken werden, in denen Sie unter Angabe teilweiser skurrilerBegründungen (z. B. Ende des Versicherungsschutzes) zur Angabe strengvertraulicher personenbezogener Daten wie beispielsweise IhreBankverbindungsdaten, Ihre Kreditkartennummer oder Ihr Passwort aufgefordertwerden. Weitergehende Informationen zu Phishing EMails und wie Sie sichschützen können, finden Sie z.B. auf den Seiten des Bundesamtes für Sicherheitin der Informationstechnik. Verwendung von CookiesEin Cookie ist ein Datenelement, das eine Webseite an Ihren Browser schickenkann, um es auf Ihrem System für eine spätere Verwendung zu speichern. Wirverwenden Cookies, um Ihr Erlebnis auf der Website deutlich zu verbessern.Einige sind technisch notwendig, um Ihnen unsere Dienste zur Verfügung stellenzu können. Andere helfen uns, die Inhalte unserer Seite zu optimieren.Beim erstmaligen Aufruf unserer Seite (sowie nach einem Löschen Ihrer CookieAuswahl in den Einstellungen Ihres Browsers) werden wir Sie nach IhrenWünschen in Bezug auf unseren CookieEinsatz fragen. Danach haben Sie zudemdie Möglichkeit, Ihre Einstellungen jederzeit individuell anzupassen.Die Einstellungsmöglichkeiten und weitere Informationen über die Technologien,die wir für notwendige Cookies, für MarketingCookies und solche fürstatistische Auswertungen unserer Webseiten einsetzen, finden Sie in unter denCookieEinstellungen. Einsatz von JavaScriptJavaScriptProgramme sind einfache, vom Server für die Ausführung im Browserheruntergeladene Programme, die es uns ermöglichen, die Bedienung unsererSeite zu erleichtern. Wir nutzen JavaScript z. B. zur Verbesserung dervisuellen Darstellungsmöglichkeiten unseres Internetauftritts, zur Navigationzwischen einzelnen Seiten und um Ihnen die Bedienung unserer Formulare, überdie Sie mit uns Kontakt aufnehmen können, zu vereinfachen.  Sie können die Nutzung von JavaScript in den Einstellungen Ihres Browsersunterbinden. In diesem Fall steht Ihnen unser Internetangebot nur noch instark eingeschränkter Form zur Verfügung.  Andere aktive Inhalte (JavaApplets und ActiveXControls) werden auf unserenWebseiten nicht verwendet. Maßnahmen zum ZugriffsschutzUnsere Datenverarbeitungssysteme sind durch Firewallsysteme gegenüber derAußenwelt geschützt. Anmeldeverfahren und Berechtigungssysteme sorgen dafür,dass interne Anwendungen nur Berechtigten zugänglich sind. VerschlüsselungVerfahren, die eine Verschlüsselung durchführen können sind z. B. RSA, DES,RC4 und DES3. Wird zum Ver und Entschlüsseln der gleiche Schlüssel verwendet,spricht man von einem symmetrischen Verschlüsselungsverfahren. Werden zum Verund Entschlüsseln unterschiedliche Schlüssel benutzt, spricht man von einemasymmetrischen Verschlüsselungsverfahren. Je länger der Schlüssel, desto höherder Zeitaufwand, ihn zu knacken.SSL (Secure Socket Layer) ist ein Verfahren, das aus einer Kombination vonasymmetrischen und symmetrischen Verschlüsselungsverfahren besteht. Zuerstschickt der Browser einen selbsterzeugten SessionKey mit dem öffentlichen1024Bit Schlüssel (RSA) des Webservers (asymmetrisches Verfahren) an denWebserver selbst. Die Entschlüsselung erfolgt dort über den geheimen RSASchlüssel, so dass von nun an Webserver und Browser mit dem SessionKeyverschlüsselt kommunizieren. Jedes Mal, wenn Sie sich wieder anmelden, wirdein neuer SessionKey erzeugt. Unsere Webserver unterstützen eineSchlüssellänge von 128 Bit (RC4) für den Session Key.Eine über SSL gesicherte Internetverbindung können Sie u. a. an der Adresse inIhrem Browser erkennen. Wenn diese mit \\'https://\\' beginnt, so ist dies z. B.ein Zeichen für eine sichere Verbindung (z. B. https://secure.generali.de).Ein weiteres Signal ist z. B. ein geschlossenes Schloss in einer der LeistenIhres Browsers. Sie können sich z. B. im Browser Microsoft Edge per Klick aufdas Schloss nähere Informationen über die Verschlüsselung der Seite ansehen.  Um eine sichere Datenübertragung zu gewährleisten, muss jedoch nicht zwingenddie Seite selbst, sondern nur die Übertragung an sich verschlüsselt werden.Die Verschlüsselung kann also z. B. auch erst dann einsetzen, wenn derDatensatz per Klick auf \\'Senden\\', \\'Abschicken\\' o. ä. verschickt wird.Bis heute sind keine Möglichkeiten zur analytischen Entschlüsselung einer128BitVerschlüsselung bekannt. Die einzige \"Angriffsmöglichkeit\" ist ein\"brute force attack\" d. h. ein vollständiges Ausprobieren aller Möglichkeiten.Für einen \"brute force attack\" bräuchten z. B. 1 Mrd. Computer, die 1. MrdSchlüssel pro Sekunde ausprobieren könnten, zum Auffinden des richtigenSchlüssels länger, als das Universum nach heutigen Erkenntnissen existiert.Die aktuell wirksame Verschlüsselung wird beim Verbindungsaufbau unterBerücksichtigung der jeweils zur Verfügung stehenden Möglichkeiten zwischenWebBrowser und WebServer ausgehandelt. Dabei sind aufgrund von frühergeltenden USamerikanischen Exportbeschränkungen zahlreiche BrowserVersionennur mit vergleichsweise schwachen Verschlüsselungsmöglichkeiten ausgestattet.Konkret bedeutet dies, dass die maximal wirksame Schlüssellänge oft auf 40 Bitbegrenzt ist.Weitere Hinweise: Weiterführende Hinweise zum Thema Sicherheit im Internetfinden Sie unter folgenden Links:   BürgerCert   BSI für Bürger  Daten\\xadver\\xadar\\xadbei\\xadtung im Rah\\xadmen unse\\xadrer SocialMediaAuf\\xadtritteEin aktueller und professionell gepflegter SocialMediaAuftritt ist einwichtiges Element unserer vorhandenen Kommunikationspolitik.

Der Anwendungsbereich der gemeinsamen Verarbeitung und des Zusatzesfür Verantwortliche erfasst die Erhebung der über das FacebookPixel erfasstenpersonenbezogenen Daten und ihre Übermittlung an Facebook Ireland. Dieanschließende Verarbeitung von Daten durch Facebook Ireland ist nicht Teil dergemeinsamen Verarbeitung.Im Rahmen des vorgenannten Zusatzes für Verantwortliche obliegt uns dieBereitstellung von Informationen zur gemeinsamen Verarbeitung vonpersonenbezogenen Daten nach Artikel 13 und 14 DSGVO. Facebook Ireland istdafür verantwortlich, die Rechte betroffener Personen gemäß Artikel 1520 derDSGVO hinsichtlich der von Facebook Ireland nach der gemeinsamen Verarbeitunggespeicherten personenbezogenen Daten zu ermöglichen. Ferner regelt der Zusatzfür Verantwortliche insbesondere:   das Erfordernis einer Rechtsgrundlage für die gemeinsame Verarbeitung (mit der Maßgabe, dass die Verantwortlichkeit hierfür Facebook Ireland und uns jeweils hinsichtlich der eigenen Verarbeitung trifft),   die Verantwortlichkeit für das Widerspruchsrecht nach Art. 21 DSGVO, soweit die gemeinsame Verarbeitung auf Artikel 6(1) lit. f DSGVO basiert (ebenfalls mit der Maßgabe, dass die Verantwortlichkeit hierfür Facebook Ireland und uns jeweils hinsichtlich der eigenen Verarbeitung trifft),   Artikel 33 u. 34 DSGVO: Die Verantwortlichkeiten bei Verletzungen des Schutzes personenbezogener Daten im Zusammenhang mit der gemeinsamen Verarbeitung,   die Verantwortlichkeit für die Meldung von Verletzungen des Schutzes personenbezogener Daten an die Aufsichtsbehörde (Art. 33 DSGVO) und für die Benachrichtigung der von einer Verletzung des Schutzes personenbezogener Daten betroffenen Person (Art. 34 DSGVO) in Abhängigkeit davon, ob eine Verletzung des Schutzes personenbezogener Daten die Verpflichtungen von Facebook Ireland oder von uns betrifft.Weitere Informationen dazu, wie Facebook Ireland personenbezogene Datenverarbeitet, einschließlich der Rechtsgrundlage, auf die Facebook Ireland sichdabei stützt, der Möglichkeiten zur Wahrnehmung der Rechte betroffenerPersonen gegenüber Facebook Ireland und zu den gemäß Artikel 13 Abs. 1 lit. a)und b) DSGVO erforderlichen Informationen finden Sie in denDatenschutzhinweisen von Facebook Ireland unterhttps://www.facebook.com/about/privacy/.  Hin\\xadweise zur Daten\\xadsi\\xadcher\\xadheitUnsere Sicherheitsvorkehrungen entsprechen dem aktuellen Stand der Technik: Geschützter ZugangAls InternetNutzer haben Sie freien Zugang zu allen öffentlichen Seiten derdeutschen Generali Gruppe. Neben diesen öffentlichen Bereichen gibt esgeschützte Bereiche, die bestimmten Benutzergruppen vorbehalten sind. DieseBereiche erfordern eine Anmeldung durch den Benutzer. Da die in diesenBereichen zugänglichen Daten schützenswert sein können, ist ein sorgfältigerUmgang mit den zur Anmeldung benötigten Informationen (insbes. Kennwörter)notwendig. Umgang mit KennwörternEin gutes Kennwort sollte mindestens 8 Zeichen lang sein, keine Namen oderWörter enthalten und sich aus Buchstaben, Ziffern und Sonderzeichenzusammensetzen. Es sollte nicht auf Ihrem PC oder im Browser gespeichertwerden. Ausführlichere Informationen zum Umgang mit Kennwörtern hat dasBundesamt für Sicherheit in der Informationstechnik (BSI) zusammengestellt. Übertragung sensibler DatenWenn Sie innerhalb unseres Internetangebots Seiten mit der Möglichkeit zurDateneingabe aufrufen und aufgefordert werden, Daten über sich einzugeben undabzuschicken, verwenden wir beim Versenden dieser Daten zur Datenübertragungüber das Internet die Verschlüsselungstechnik SSL (Secure Socket Layer) miteiner Schlüssellänge von mindestens 128Bit. Bis heute sind keineMöglichkeiten zur analytischen Entschlüsselung einer solchen 128BitVerschlüsselung bekannt. Den Einsatz von SSL können Sie u. a. an der Adressebzw. URL (die in einem solchen Fall mit HTTPS beginnt) oder an dem Schloss inder Statusleiste Ihres Webbrowsers erkennen. EMailsMitteilungen, die personenbezogene Daten enthalten, versenden wir nichtunverschlüsselt per EMail.  Sollten Sie selbst unverschlüsselte EMails an uns versenden, beachten Sie,dass diese bei der Übertragung im Internet nicht gegen Kenntnisnahme oderManipulation durch unbefugte Dritte geschützt sind.  Bevor Sie uns eine EMail schicken, bedenken Sie bitte, dass deren Inhalt imInternet nicht gegen unbefugte Kenntnisnahme, Verfälschung usw. geschützt ist.Aus diesem Grund ist es empfehlenswert ein Kontaktformular zu nutzen, wenn Sieeine Nachricht an die Generali Deutschland Krankenversicherung AG, dieGenerali Deutschland Lebensversicherung AG oder die Generali DeutschlandVersicherung AG schicken möchten. PhishingPhishingBetrüger fälschen EMails und Internetseiten, um an Ihrevertraulichen Daten wie bspw. Passwörter oder sonstige sensible Datenheranzukommen. Bitte beachten Sie, dass wir niemals EMails oder SMSverschicken werden, in denen Sie unter Angabe teilweiser skurrilerBegründungen (z. B. Ende des Versicherungsschutzes) zur Angabe strengvertraulicher personenbezogener Daten wie beispielsweise IhreBankverbindungsdaten, Ihre Kreditkartennummer oder Ihr Passwort aufgefordertwerden. Weitergehende Informationen zu Phishing EMails und wie Sie sichschützen können, finden Sie z.B. auf den Seiten des Bundesamtes für Sicherheitin der Informationstechnik. Verwendung von CookiesEin Cookie ist ein Datenelement, das eine Webseite an Ihren Browser schickenkann, um es auf Ihrem System für eine spätere Verwendung zu speichern. Wirverwenden Cookies, um Ihr Erlebnis auf der Website deutlich zu verbessern.Einige sind technisch notwendig, um Ihnen unsere Dienste zur Verfügung stellenzu können. Andere helfen uns, die Inhalte unserer Seite zu optimieren.Beim erstmaligen Aufruf unserer Seite (sowie nach einem Löschen Ihrer CookieAuswahl in den Einstellungen Ihres Browsers) werden wir Sie nach IhrenWünschen in Bezug auf unseren CookieEinsatz fragen. Danach haben Sie zudemdie Möglichkeit, Ihre Einstellungen jederzeit individuell anzupassen.Die Einstellungsmöglichkeiten und weitere Informationen über die Technologien,die wir für notwendige Cookies, für MarketingCookies und solche fürstatistische Auswertungen unserer Webseiten einsetzen, finden Sie in unter denCookieEinstellungen. Einsatz von JavaScriptJavaScriptProgramme sind einfache, vom Server für die Ausführung im Browserheruntergeladene Programme, die es uns ermöglichen, die Bedienung unsererSeite zu erleichtern. Wir nutzen JavaScript z. B. zur Verbesserung dervisuellen Darstellungsmöglichkeiten unseres Internetauftritts, zur Navigationzwischen einzelnen Seiten und um Ihnen die Bedienung unserer Formulare, überdie Sie mit uns Kontakt aufnehmen können, zu vereinfachen.  Sie können die Nutzung von JavaScript in den Einstellungen Ihres Browsersunterbinden. In diesem Fall steht Ihnen unser Internetangebot nur noch instark eingeschränkter Form zur Verfügung.  Andere aktive Inhalte (JavaApplets und ActiveXControls) werden auf unserenWebseiten nicht verwendet. Maßnahmen zum ZugriffsschutzUnsere Datenverarbeitungssysteme sind durch Firewallsysteme gegenüber derAußenwelt geschützt. Anmeldeverfahren und Berechtigungssysteme sorgen dafür,dass interne Anwendungen nur Berechtigten zugänglich sind. VerschlüsselungVerfahren, die eine Verschlüsselung durchführen können sind z. B. RSA, DES,RC4 und DES3. Wird zum Ver und Entschlüsseln der gleiche Schlüssel verwendet,spricht man von einem symmetrischen Verschlüsselungsverfahren. Werden zum Verund Entschlüsseln unterschiedliche Schlüssel benutzt, spricht man von einemasymmetrischen Verschlüsselungsverfahren. Je länger der Schlüssel, desto höherder Zeitaufwand, ihn zu knacken.SSL (Secure Socket Layer) ist ein Verfahren, das aus einer Kombination vonasymmetrischen und symmetrischen Verschlüsselungsverfahren besteht. Zuerstschickt der Browser einen selbsterzeugten SessionKey mit dem öffentlichen1024Bit Schlüssel (RSA) des Webservers (asymmetrisches Verfahren) an denWebserver selbst. Die Entschlüsselung erfolgt dort über den geheimen RSASchlüssel, so dass von nun an Webserver und Browser mit dem SessionKeyverschlüsselt kommunizieren. Jedes Mal, wenn Sie sich wieder anmelden, wirdein neuer SessionKey erzeugt. Unsere Webserver unterstützen eineSchlüssellänge von 128 Bit (RC4) für den Session Key.Eine über SSL gesicherte Internetverbindung können Sie u. a. an der Adresse inIhrem Browser erkennen. Wenn diese mit \\'https://\\' beginnt, so ist dies z. B.ein Zeichen für eine sichere Verbindung (z. B. https://secure.generali.de).Ein weiteres Signal ist z. B. ein geschlossenes Schloss in einer der LeistenIhres Browsers. Sie können sich z. B. im Browser Microsoft Edge per Klick aufdas Schloss nähere Informationen über die Verschlüsselung der Seite ansehen.  Um eine sichere Datenübertragung zu gewährleisten, muss jedoch nicht zwingenddie Seite selbst, sondern nur die Übertragung an sich verschlüsselt werden.Die Verschlüsselung kann also z. B. auch erst dann einsetzen, wenn derDatensatz per Klick auf \\'Senden\\', \\'Abschicken\\' o. ä. verschickt wird.Bis heute sind keine Möglichkeiten zur analytischen Entschlüsselung einer128BitVerschlüsselung bekannt. Die einzige \"Angriffsmöglichkeit\" ist ein\"brute force attack\" d. h. ein vollständiges Ausprobieren aller Möglichkeiten.Für einen \"brute force attack\" bräuchten z. B. 1 Mrd. Computer, die 1. MrdSchlüssel pro Sekunde ausprobieren könnten, zum Auffinden des richtigenSchlüssels länger, als das Universum nach heutigen Erkenntnissen existiert.Die aktuell wirksame Verschlüsselung wird beim Verbindungsaufbau unterBerücksichtigung der jeweils zur Verfügung stehenden Möglichkeiten zwischenWebBrowser und WebServer ausgehandelt. Dabei sind aufgrund von frühergeltenden USamerikanischen Exportbeschränkungen zahlreiche BrowserVersionennur mit vergleichsweise schwachen Verschlüsselungsmöglichkeiten ausgestattet.Konkret bedeutet dies, dass die maximal wirksame Schlüssellänge oft auf 40 Bitbegrenzt ist.Weitere Hinweise: Weiterführende Hinweise zum Thema Sicherheit im Internetfinden Sie unter folgenden Links:   BürgerCert   BSI für Bürger  Daten\\xadver\\xadar\\xadbei\\xadtung im Rah\\xadmen unse\\xadrer SocialMediaAuf\\xadtritteEin aktueller und professionell gepflegter SocialMediaAuftritt ist einwichtiges Element unserer vorhandenen Kommunikationspolitik.

Auf Gewinne müssen wirtrotzdem nicht verzichten. Wir handeln fair und verantwortungsbewusst. UnserVerhalten wirkt sich positiv auf unsere Stakeholder aus. Es verringert dasRisiko für unsere Investitionen und schützt unseren Ruf.Schon 2006 hat die Generali Gruppe ihr Engagement für verantwortungsbewusstesInvestieren definiert. 2010 hat sie ihre eigenen ethischen Richtlinien für dieGruppe verabschiedet. Im Jahr 2015 haben wir unser Engagement weiter gestärkt,indem wir unser Responsible Investment Group Committee eingerichtet haben.Unser Verhalten am Markt ist seitdem in der Responsible Investment GroupRichtlinie geregelt. Ziel ist es, die ESG Faktoren in Entscheidungen unseresManagements über Investments zu integrieren.Im Jahr 2020 haben wir außerdem unsere Active Ownership Guideline (Richtliniefür aktives Eigentümerverhalten) veröffentlicht. Wir möchten hier unsere Rolleals Investor nutzen, damit sich durch sinnvolle Investitionen etwas zumPositiven verändert.Der Vorstand der Generali Gruppe hat alle Empfehlungen des neuen italienischenCorporate Governance Kodex angenommen. Diese Entscheidung haben wir am 14.Oktober 2020 veröffentlicht. Der Kodex soll sicherstellen, dass börsennotierteitalienische Unternehmen sich ständig an internationalen Best Practicesorientieren. Das Konzept soll zu nachhaltigem Erfolg führen. Werden dieBedingungen berücksichtigt, entsteht ein langfristiger Wert zum Nutzen unsererAktionäre und unserer relevanten Stakeholder. Nachhaltiger Erfolg ist für unsein Ziel, das die Handlungen unserer Vorstände bestimmt. Dieses Ziel haben wirin unsere Geschäftsprozesse und in die gesamte Organisation der GeneraliGruppe integriert. Unser Umgang mit den ESGFaktorenMit den Umwelt, Sozial und UnternehmenführungFaktoren (ESG) können wirbewerten, wie nachhaltig die Geschäftstätigkeit eines Unternehmens ist.Verhält sich ein Unternehmen, in das wir investieren nicht korrekt, wirkt sichdies auf sein Geschäft aus. Eine Bewertung anhand der ESGFaktoren zeigt unsfrühzeitig mögliche schwerwiegende Probleme im Unternehmen selbst.Umweltverstöße (EFaktor) weisen nicht nur auf mangelnde Verantwortung hin.Sie können auch zu Geldstrafen führen. Außerdem entstehen mitunter hohe Kostenfür die Beseitigung von Umweltschäden.Auf die gleiche Weise können Menschenrechts und Arbeitsrechtsverletzungen(SFaktor) den Ruf des Unternehmens beeinträchtigen. Mangelndes Bewusstseinfür ethische Grundsätze oder deren Missachtung führen zu großen Imageschäden.Ein Unternehmen mit einem beschädigten Ruf hat viele Probleme:   seine Produkte werden boykottiert   die Kapitalbeschaffung wird schwierig   Strafen werden verhängt   Geschäftsmöglichkeiten gehen verlorenIm Falle von Korruption (GFaktoren) sind Unternehmen hohen ethischen,geschäftlichen, rechtlichen und finanziellen Risiken ausgesetzt. Wenn sie dieKorruption nicht wirksam bekämpfen, wirkt sich das äußerst negativ auf dieGeschäftsentwicklung aus.Die Generali Gruppe erkennt diese Nachhaltigkeitsrisiken anhand einer internenBewertung. Sie stellt fest, ob Unternehmen nach den Grundsätzen des UN GlobalCompact handeln.Erkennen wir Fälle von Menschenrechtsverletzungen und Verletzungen vonArbeitsrechten, Umweltschäden und Korruption, investieren wir nicht in diesesUnternehmen. Das haben wir in unseren Richtlinien für verantwortungsbewussteAnlagen festgelegt. Wir beziehen die ESGFaktoren immer in unsereEntscheidungen ein.Wir aktualisieren unsere Bewertungen kontinuierlich. So erkennen wir möglicheneue Verstöße gegen die ESGFaktoren unserer Investments sofort.Diese Fälle erörtern und bewerten wir zweimal im Jahr in unserem ResponsibleInvestment Committee. In dem Committee definieren wir neueAusschlusskriterien. Außerdem überprüfen wir den methodischen Ansatz, stärkenund verbessern die Bewertungskriterien. Identifizierung und Priorisierung: Was wirkt sich besonders negativ aufdie Nachhaltigkeit aus?Fehlgeleitete Investitionsentscheidungen können sich möglicherweise nachteiligauf Stakeholder, Umwelt und Gesellschaft auswirken. Deshalb haben wir einenklaren Rahmen festgelegt, in dem wir uns mit unseren Anlageentscheidungenbewegen. Schließlich wird das Risiko von den Versicherungsunternehmen getragenoder mit den Versicherungsnehmern geteilt. Es liegt in unserer Verantwortung,nachteilige Auswirkungen zu minimieren und die Unternehmen, in die wirinvestieren, durch unser Abstimmungsverhalten und unser Engagement aktiv zusteuern.Unsere Group Responsible Investment Guidelines verpflichten uns, unsereAnlageentscheidungen auf die Interessen unserer Stakeholder, insbesondereunserer Kunden, auf die der Gesellschaft und der Umwelt insgesamt abzustimmen.Darüber hinaus bewertet der Konzern alle 3 Jahre die eigeneNachhaltigkeitsstrategie. Welche ESGFaktoren sind möglicherweise in Bezug aufunsere Aktivitäten, unsere Geschäftsstrategie und den Kontext, in dem wirarbeiten, relevant?Die verschiedenen Geschäftsbereiche des Konzerns unterstützen die Bewertung.Wie bei den anderen Geschäftsaktivitäten des Konzerns werden die wichtigstenNachhaltigkeitsfaktoren für die Investitionstätigkeit analysiert. Wir suchennach solchen systemischen Änderungen, die in den nächsten 10 Jahren erheblicheChancen und Risiken für den Konzern mit sich bringen können.Dies ist ein wesentlicher Schritt, um zu identifizieren und zu priorisieren,wie sich externe Ereignisse auf die Generali Gruppe auswirken.\"Nachhaltigkeitsfaktoren\" sind Umwelt, Sozial undArbeitnehmerangelegenheiten, Achtung der Menschenrechte, Bekämpfung vonKorruption und Bekämpfung von Bestechung. Jede Anlageentscheidung kann sichnegativ auf diese Faktoren auswirken.Der Klimawandel ist von zentraler Bedeutung für unser Investmentgeschäft. Erwirkt sich auf unsere Anlageentscheidungen aus. Und er ist ein wesentlichesRisiko für die Portfolios der GeneraliGruppe. Als Investor können wir dieUnternehmen beeinflussen, in die wir investieren. Wir können unsereInvestitionen in umweltverschmutzende Unternehmen reduzieren und mehrFinanzmittel für sauberere und umweltfreundlichere Aktivitäten bereitstellen.Aber wir wirken nicht nur über Investitionsentscheidungen, Käufe und Verkäufeauf sie ein. Wir können auch mit Unternehmen zusammenarbeiten und siemotivieren, gemeinsam mit uns die globale Erwärmung zu reduzieren.Drei nachteilige Auswirkungen beeinflussen die Nachhaltigkeitsfaktoren ganzerheblich. Sie wirken sich sehr negativ auf Umwelt und Gesellschaft aus. Inunseren Richtlinien für verantwortungsbewusste Investitionen und in unsererWesentlichkeitsmatrix haben wir sie dargestellt:1\\\\. Der CO2Fußabdruck (Carbon Footprint) unserer InvestitionenDurch unsere Investitionsentscheidungen können wir Unternehmen und Aktivitätenfinanzieren, die einen höheren oder niedrigeren CO2Ausstoß aufweisen. Einetransparente Sicht auf den CO2Fußabdruck unserer Portfolien und Investitionenzeigt, wie gut unsere Investitionen eine sauberere und umweltfreundlichereWelt fördern. Im Januar 2020 trat die GeneraliGruppe der Initiative Net ZeroAsset Owner Alliance bei. Sie wird von den Vereinten Nationen und PRI(Principles for Responsible Investments) gefördert. Im Rahmen dieserInitiative haben wir uns verpflichtet, unser Anlageportfolio bis 2050 an denNettoCO2Emissionen von Null auszurichten. Diese Reduzierung beeinflussteinerseits unsere Investitionsentscheidungen z. B. mit dem Verkaufumweltschädlicher Unternehmen. Anderseits treiben wir auch dieDekarbonisierung (Verringerung des CO2Fußabdrucks) der Unternehmen voran, indie wir investiert haben.Durch diese langfristige Initiative wollen wir die Klimaauswirkungen unsererInvestitionen minimieren. Die Wirtschaft und die Gesellschaft möchten wirpositiv auf eine nachhaltigere Zukunft ausrichten.Wir berechnen den CO2Fußabdruck unserer Portfolios mithilfe mathematischerFormeln:   Stärke des durchschnittlichen gewichteten Kohlenstoffanteils im Portfolio   Stärke des gesamten Kohlenstoff \"Fußabdrucks\" zur Messung des Einflusses auf die Umwelt   Stärke des einzelnen Kohlenstoff \"Fußabdrucks\" gemessen je Investition zur besseren Vergleichbarkeit2\\\\. Verstöße gegen die Grundsätze des UN Global CompactUnsere Richtlinien für verantwortungsbewusstes Investieren beinhalten einenethischen Filter. So vermeiden wir Investitionen in Unternehmen, die fürethische Verstöße verantwortlich sind. Das können z. B. Missachtungen derGrundsätze des UN Global Compact oder Verwicklungen in kontroverseGeschäftsbereiche sein.Wir investieren nicht in   Unternehmen, die an schwerwiegenden oder systematischen Menschenrechts und/oder Arbeitsrechtsverletzungen beteiligt sind;   Unternehmen, die an schweren Umweltschäden beteiligt sind;   Unternehmen, die in Fälle von grober Korruption und Bestechung verwickelt sind.Basierend auf einer ESGBewertung schließen wir solche Unternehmen aus unseremAnlageuniversum aus, die die Anforderungen der Generali Gruppe nicht erfüllen.Alternativ werden sie streng überwacht und möglicherweise beauftragt, ihrethisches Verhalten weiter zu verbessern.Erkennen wir diese Probleme in einem bestehenden Anlageengagement, verbietenwir neue Investitionen, veräußern unsere Beteiligung an diesen Unternehmen undlassen festverzinsliche Wertpapiere auslaufen.3\\\\. Geschäfte mit umstrittenen WaffenNach unseren ethischen Grundsätzen investieren wir nicht in Unternehmen, dieumstrittene Waffen einsetzen, entwickeln, produzieren, erwerben, lagern oderHandel damit betreiben.Umstrittene Waffen sind:   Streubomben   AntipersonenLandminen   Atomwaffen   biologische und chemische WaffenAuch Dienstleister und Unternehmen mit Schlüsselfunktionen rund um umstritteneWaffen filtern wir heraus und lehnen die Zusammenarbeit ab.Unsere Anlagestrategie ermöglicht es uns, wesentliche nachteilige Auswirkungenzu identifizieren und zu überwachen.

Das NachhaltigkeitsEngagement ist eine Säule der Geschäftsprioritäten von Generali. Es ist vollständig in die Vergütungspolitik und das Anreizsystem der Gruppe eingebettet, zusammen mit einer langfristigen nachhaltigen Wertschöpfung.   Das Anreizsystem für unsere Vorstände und das obere Management basiert auf einem leistungsorientierten Ansatz und einer mehrjährigen Rahmenvereinbarung. Es kombiniert eine jährliche variable Barvergütung mit einer aufgeschobenen aktienbasierten variablen Vergütung.Das Anreizsystem verbindet die strategischen Ziele \"Nachhaltigkeit / ESG\"(Environmental Social Governance / Umwelt, Soziales und Unternehmensführung)mit den Generali Zielen für 2021 sowie den Generali Klimazielen. Diese hat dieGenerali bereits veröffentlicht:   Mindestens 20% der jährlichen variablen Barvergütung von TopManagern sind an die ESGZiele sowie an folgende Kennzahlen gebunden:     Inklusion und Vielfalt der Mitarbeiter (z. B. Diversity & Inclusion Index)     Marke & Lifetime Partner (z. B. Wir messen, ob Konsumenten ein Produkt weiterempfehlen)     Nachhaltigkeit (z. B. prozentuales Wachstum nachhaltiger Investitionen und Produkte     Entwicklung unseres gesellschaftlichen Engagements durch \"The Human Safety Net\" = Generali Programm mit dem Ziel, das Potential von Menschen zur Entfaltung zu bringen, die unter schwierigen Bedingungen leben.   Die aufgeschobene aktienbasierte variable Vergütung zahlt auf langfristige, nachhaltige Wertschöpfung ein.   Die Konzernvergütungspolitik bezieht Nachhaltigkeitsrisiken bei Anlageentscheidungen ein. Sie stützt sich dabei auf spezifische konzerninterne Vorschriften.   Ein vorrangiges Ziel unserer Gruppe ist es, Nachhaltigkeit und Vergütung immer besser miteinander zu verknüpfen.ESG: Environmental Social Governance / Umwelt, Soziales und Unternehmensführung

Welche ESGFaktoren sind möglicherweise in Bezug aufunsere Aktivitäten, unsere Geschäftsstrategie und den Kontext, in dem wirarbeiten, relevant?Die verschiedenen Geschäftsbereiche des Konzerns unterstützen die Bewertung.Wie bei den anderen Geschäftsaktivitäten des Konzerns werden die wichtigstenNachhaltigkeitsfaktoren für die Investitionstätigkeit analysiert. Wir suchennach solchen systemischen Änderungen, die in den nächsten 10 Jahren erheblicheChancen und Risiken für den Konzern mit sich bringen können.Dies ist ein wesentlicher Schritt, um zu identifizieren und zu priorisieren,wie sich externe Ereignisse auf die Generali Gruppe auswirken.\"Nachhaltigkeitsfaktoren\" sind Umwelt, Sozial undArbeitnehmerangelegenheiten, Achtung der Menschenrechte, Bekämpfung vonKorruption und Bekämpfung von Bestechung. Jede Anlageentscheidung kann sichnegativ auf diese Faktoren auswirken.Der Klimawandel ist von zentraler Bedeutung für unser Investmentgeschäft. Erwirkt sich auf unsere Anlageentscheidungen aus. Und er ist ein wesentlichesRisiko für die Portfolios der GeneraliGruppe. Als Investor können wir dieUnternehmen beeinflussen, in die wir investieren. Wir können unsereInvestitionen in umweltverschmutzende Unternehmen reduzieren und mehrFinanzmittel für sauberere und umweltfreundlichere Aktivitäten bereitstellen.Aber wir wirken nicht nur über Investitionsentscheidungen, Käufe und Verkäufeauf sie ein. Wir können auch mit Unternehmen zusammenarbeiten und siemotivieren, gemeinsam mit uns die globale Erwärmung zu reduzieren.Drei nachteilige Auswirkungen beeinflussen die Nachhaltigkeitsfaktoren ganzerheblich. Sie wirken sich sehr negativ auf Umwelt und Gesellschaft aus. Inunseren Richtlinien für verantwortungsbewusste Investitionen und in unsererWesentlichkeitsmatrix haben wir sie dargestellt:1\\\\. Der CO2Fußabdruck (Carbon Footprint) unserer InvestitionenDurch unsere Investitionsentscheidungen können wir Unternehmen und Aktivitätenfinanzieren, die einen höheren oder niedrigeren CO2Ausstoß aufweisen. Einetransparente Sicht auf den CO2Fußabdruck unserer Portfolien und Investitionenzeigt, wie gut unsere Investitionen eine sauberere und umweltfreundlichereWelt fördern. Im Januar 2020 trat die GeneraliGruppe der Initiative Net ZeroAsset Owner Alliance bei. Sie wird von den Vereinten Nationen und PRI(Principles for Responsible Investments) gefördert. Im Rahmen dieserInitiative haben wir uns verpflichtet, unser Anlageportfolio bis 2050 an denNettoCO2Emissionen von Null auszurichten. Diese Reduzierung beeinflussteinerseits unsere Investitionsentscheidungen z. B. mit dem Verkaufumweltschädlicher Unternehmen. Anderseits treiben wir auch dieDekarbonisierung (Verringerung des CO2Fußabdrucks) der Unternehmen voran, indie wir investiert haben.Durch diese langfristige Initiative wollen wir die Klimaauswirkungen unsererInvestitionen minimieren. Die Wirtschaft und die Gesellschaft möchten wirpositiv auf eine nachhaltigere Zukunft ausrichten.Wir berechnen den CO2Fußabdruck unserer Portfolios mithilfe mathematischerFormeln:   Stärke des durchschnittlichen gewichteten Kohlenstoffanteils im Portfolio   Stärke des gesamten Kohlenstoff \"Fußabdrucks\" zur Messung des Einflusses auf die Umwelt   Stärke des einzelnen Kohlenstoff \"Fußabdrucks\" gemessen je Investition zur besseren Vergleichbarkeit2\\\\. Verstöße gegen die Grundsätze des UN Global CompactUnsere Richtlinien für verantwortungsbewusstes Investieren beinhalten einenethischen Filter. So vermeiden wir Investitionen in Unternehmen, die fürethische Verstöße verantwortlich sind. Das können z. B. Missachtungen derGrundsätze des UN Global Compact oder Verwicklungen in kontroverseGeschäftsbereiche sein.Wir investieren nicht in   Unternehmen, die an schwerwiegenden oder systematischen Menschenrechts und/oder Arbeitsrechtsverletzungen beteiligt sind;   Unternehmen, die an schweren Umweltschäden beteiligt sind;   Unternehmen, die in Fälle von grober Korruption und Bestechung verwickelt sind.Basierend auf einer ESGBewertung schließen wir solche Unternehmen aus unseremAnlageuniversum aus, die die Anforderungen der Generali Gruppe nicht erfüllen.Alternativ werden sie streng überwacht und möglicherweise beauftragt, ihrethisches Verhalten weiter zu verbessern.Erkennen wir diese Probleme in einem bestehenden Anlageengagement, verbietenwir neue Investitionen, veräußern unsere Beteiligung an diesen Unternehmen undlassen festverzinsliche Wertpapiere auslaufen.3\\\\. Geschäfte mit umstrittenen WaffenNach unseren ethischen Grundsätzen investieren wir nicht in Unternehmen, dieumstrittene Waffen einsetzen, entwickeln, produzieren, erwerben, lagern oderHandel damit betreiben.Umstrittene Waffen sind:   Streubomben   AntipersonenLandminen   Atomwaffen   biologische und chemische WaffenAuch Dienstleister und Unternehmen mit Schlüsselfunktionen rund um umstritteneWaffen filtern wir heraus und lehnen die Zusammenarbeit ab.Unsere Anlagestrategie ermöglicht es uns, wesentliche nachteilige Auswirkungenzu identifizieren und zu überwachen.  Trans\\xadpa\\xadrenz der Ver\\xadgü\\xadtungs\\xadpo\\xadli\\xadtik im Zusam\\xadmen\\xadhang mit derBerück\\xadsich\\xadti\\xadgung von Nach\\xadhal\\xadtig\\xadkeits\\xadri\\xadsi\\xadken (Arti\\xadkel 5, OffVO)Stand: 19.07.2021   Die Generali strebt ein langfristiges Wachstum an, integriert Nachhaltigkeit in das Kerngeschäft und agiert als Lifetime Partner der Stakeholder.   Das NachhaltigkeitsEngagement ist eine Säule der Geschäftsprioritäten von Generali. Es ist vollständig in die Vergütungspolitik und das Anreizsystem der Gruppe eingebettet, zusammen mit einer langfristigen nachhaltigen Wertschöpfung.   Das Anreizsystem für unsere Vorstände und das obere Management basiert auf einem leistungsorientierten Ansatz und einer mehrjährigen Rahmenvereinbarung. Es kombiniert eine jährliche variable Barvergütung mit einer aufgeschobenen aktienbasierten variablen Vergütung.Das Anreizsystem verbindet die strategischen Ziele \"Nachhaltigkeit / ESG\"(Environmental Social Governance / Umwelt, Soziales und Unternehmensführung)mit den Generali Zielen für 2021 sowie den Generali Klimazielen. Diese hat dieGenerali bereits veröffentlicht:   Mindestens 20% der jährlichen variablen Barvergütung von TopManagern sind an die ESGZiele sowie an folgende Kennzahlen gebunden:     Inklusion und Vielfalt der Mitarbeiter (z. B. Diversity & Inclusion Index)     Marke & Lifetime Partner (z. B. Wir messen, ob Konsumenten ein Produkt weiterempfehlen)     Nachhaltigkeit (z. B. prozentuales Wachstum nachhaltiger Investitionen und Produkte     Entwicklung unseres gesellschaftlichen Engagements durch \"The Human Safety Net\" = Generali Programm mit dem Ziel, das Potential von Menschen zur Entfaltung zu bringen, die unter schwierigen Bedingungen leben.   Die aufgeschobene aktienbasierte variable Vergütung zahlt auf langfristige, nachhaltige Wertschöpfung ein.   Die Konzernvergütungspolitik bezieht Nachhaltigkeitsrisiken bei Anlageentscheidungen ein. Sie stützt sich dabei auf spezifische konzerninterne Vorschriften.   Ein vorrangiges Ziel unserer Gruppe ist es, Nachhaltigkeit und Vergütung immer besser miteinander zu verknüpfen.ESG: Environmental Social Governance / Umwelt, Soziales und Unternehmensführung  Trans\\xadpa\\xadrenz bei der Bewer\\xadbung öko\\xadlo\\xadgi\\xadscher oder sozia\\xadler Merk\\xadmaleund bei nach\\xadhal\\xadti\\xadgen Inves\\xadti\\xadtio\\xadnen auf Inter\\xadnetsei\\xadten (Arti\\xadkel 10,OffVO) Stand: 14.02.2023Web\\xadsite Offen\\xadle\\xadgung der Gene\\xadrali Deutsch\\xadland Lebens\\xadver\\xadsi\\xadche\\xadrung AG  Ände\\xadrungs\\xadver\\xadzeich\\xadnis (Arti\\xadkel 12, OffVO)Aktuelle  Ände\\xadrungs\\xadin\\xadfor\\xadma\\xadtio\\xadnen  Pro\\xaddukt\\xadbe\\xadzo\\xadgene Infor\\xadma\\xadtio\\xadnenInformationen zu den Nachhaltigkeitsmerkmalen auf Produktebene  Gene\\xadrali Pro\\xadtect Me AppSicher zu Hause oder unterwegs: Erhalten Sie ortsgenaue Wetterwarnungen aufIhr Handy.MEHR ERFAHRENAUS VERSICHERUNG WIRD VERBESSERUNG   X (ehem. twitter)   Youtube   Instagram   Facebook   Linkedin   XingService   OnlineServices und Formulare    Vertragsinformationen anfordern   Daten ändern   Rechnung einreichen    Schaden melden    Apps    Kontakt Service   OnlineServices und Formulare    Vertragsinformationen anfordern   Daten ändern   Rechnung einreichen    Schaden melden    Apps    Kontakt Produkte   KfzVersicherung    Krankenvollversicherung    Krankenzusatzversicherung    Privathaftpflicht    Hausratversicherung    Unfallversicherung    Berufsunfähigkeit Produkte   KfzVersicherung    Krankenvollversicherung    Krankenzusatzversicherung    Privathaftpflicht    Hausratversicherung    Unfallversicherung    Berufsunfähigkeit Apps   Generali GesundheitsApp    Generali VitalityApp    Generali Mobile Health App    Generali Protect Me App Apps   Generali GesundheitsApp    Generali VitalityApp    Generali Mobile Health App    Generali Protect Me App Über Generali   Über uns    Karriere    Management    Zahlen, Daten, Fakten    Nachhaltigkeit    Soziales Engagement    Public Affairs    Presse Über Generali   Über uns    Karriere    Management    Zahlen, Daten, Fakten    Nachhaltigkeit    Soziales Engagement    Public Affairs    Presse    Impressum    Datenschutz    Cookies    Menschenrechte    Nachhaltigkeitsbezogene Offenlegung    Generali weltweit © Generali 2025   Impressum    Datenschutz    Cookies    Menschenrechte    Nachhaltigkeitsbezogene Offenlegung    Generali weltweit © Generali 2025  \\n[end of content]  \\n\\nAnswer : \\nif the content is related to description, then answer with the category name. \\n\\n'}, rets='Commercial Insurance', error=None, perf=Perf(start_time=datetime.datetime(2025, 1, 17, 2, 58, 28, 767326), end_time=datetime.datetime(2025, 1, 17, 2, 58, 39, 500507)), pid=39040, tid=283663)], experimental_otel_spans=[], feedback_and_future_results=[(FeedbackDefinition(Ground Truth Similarity (LLM),\n",

LocalStorage ermöglicht es zum Beispiel, Ihre einmal getroffenenNutzereinstellungen weiterhin bei einem neuen Aufruf unserer Seitebeizubehalten.  Dabei werden Daten lokal in Ihrem Browser gespeichert. Diese Daten bleibenauch nach dem Beenden Ihres Browsers weiterhin bestehen. Sie können den LocalStorage Ihres Browsers jederzeit selbst löschen.    Session StorageDie Session Storage Technik ist weitestgehend mit der Local Storage Technikidentisch. Daten, die im SessionStorage gespeichert sind, werden jedoch nachAblauf einer Nutzungssession automatisiert gelöscht.  Umgang mit EMail und anderen KommunikationsmedienSie können mit der ARAG über diverse Kommunikationskanäle in Verbindungtreten. Welche Daten dabei entstehen und wie damit umgegangen wird erfahrenSie nachfolgend.  Neben den nachfolgend beschriebenen Kommunikationskanälen gibt Informationenund Services, die von Ihrem Versicherungsbetreuer zur Verfügung gestellt undverantwortet werden.    Wenn Sie direkt mit Ihrem Versicherungsbetreuer Kontakt aufnehmen, liegen diedabei übermittelten Daten außerhalb des Einflussbereichs der ARAG.  Dies gilt zum Beispiel für:  \\\\ WhatsAppKommunikation über die Rufnummer Ihres Beraters ebenso andere  \\\\ Messenger Dienste, wie FacebookMessenger  \\\\ Facebook Seite Ihres Beraters  \\\\ EMailKommunikation an EMailAdressen ohne die Endung „ARAG.de“    Für Auskünfte diesbezüglich wenden Sie sich bitte an Ihren Berater vor Ort.  Schriftliche KommunikationEingehender Schriftwechsel wird in der Regel unmittelbar nach dem Eingangdigitalisiert (gescannt) und elektronisch an die zuständige Fachabteilungweitergeleitet. Das digitale Dokument wird dort so lange gespeichert, wie derZweck bzw. die gesetzlichen Aufbewahrungspflichten es erfordern. DasOriginaldokument wird nach einer Karenzzeit von in der Regel 4 Wochendatenschutzgerecht vernichtet.  EMailSofern Sie der ARAG eine EMailAdresse mitteilen, nutzt die ARAG dieseausschließlich um Ihnen die erbetenen Informationen, im Rahmen des rechtlichErlaubten, zuzusenden. Sensible personenbezogene Daten versendet die ARAGderzeit allerdings ausschließlich über ausreichend abgesicherteKommunikationskanäle, wie z.B. Postversand.  Soweit Sie uns Ihre EMailAdresse im Rahmen eines Versicherungsverhältnissesmitteilen und wir Ihnen diese EMailAdresse eindeutig zuordnen können, nutzenwir diese, um Ihnen Ihre Vertragspost zu übermitteln, sofern Sie dieserKommunikationsform nicht widersprochen haben. Der vorab beschriebenKommunikationskanal wird aus rechtlichen Gründen in den Sparten Kranken undUnfallversicherung derzeit noch nicht angeboten.  EMailNachrichten werden in Abhängigkeit von ihrem Inhalt archiviert und fürdie Dauer der gesetzlichen Aufbewahrungspflichten gespeichert.    Eine Weitergabe Ihrer EMailAdresse an Dritte erfolgt durch die ARAG nicht.Ebenso nutzt die ARAG Ihre EMailAdresse für EMailWerbung nur dann, wennIhre ausdrückliche Einwilligung hierfür vorliegt.  Die ARAG verwendet Ihre EMailAdresse zur Zusendung des „ARAG Newsletters“,wenn Sie hierzu im Rahmen der NewsletterAnforderung die notwendigeEinwilligung erteilt haben.
