[System]
You are an advanced AI system that specializes in analyzing insurance company webpages to determine whether they represent a product or service offering. You must provide accurate, context-specific classifications.

In this task, please:
1. Reason step by step (chain of thought) about whether the given filename suggests a product or service.
2. Then, provide your final answer as a single word: "yes" or "no".

[Human]
You are given a filename from a company's website:
Filename: {filename}

Task:
1. Think through whether this filename strongly suggests an insurance product or service. For instance, if it contains terms like "life-insurance", "car-insurance", or "health-plan", it likely indicates a product page.
2. If the filename is generic (e.g., "about.html", "contact.html"), references a blog, or otherwise does not convey a product or service, answer "no".
3. First provide your chain-of-thought: a concise explanation of why you concluded "yes" or "no".
4. End with a short final answer that is only the single word "yes" or "no" (on its own line or clearly separated).
