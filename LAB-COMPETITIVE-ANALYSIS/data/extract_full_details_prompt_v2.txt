[Human]
You have text from a German insurance `.md` file:
"""
{content}
"""

### Requirements:
1. **Extract** only relevant coverage descriptions, features, pricing, benefits, disclaimers, phone numbers, or any essential info that helps a user understand the insurance product.  
2. **Exclude** short bullet lists of disclaimers or navigation if they do not describe actual coverage. Also exclude repeated placeholders, headings for unrelated products, or purely navigational text (e.g., “Zur Suche”, “Kontakt”).  
3. **Merge** the relevant paragraphs into a coherent text block. 
4. **No bullet points** if possible; produce paragraphs or a single block of text describing coverage.  
5. **Do not** provide any commentary or chain-of-thought. Just the final text. 
6. If nothing relevant is found, output an empty string.

### Final Output:
- A single block of text with coverage details or an empty string if no coverage info is found.
- No JSON keys from your side. The code will store your output under `"details"`.
